 MIF_AME_Gair_Impeachment_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nGair has become the epicenter of intense internal conflict in the United American Republic due to his actions regarding America’s megacorporations. He faces serious accusations from Congress who claim he's involved in Bribery, Negligence of the Public Welfare, Subversion of Democratic Principles, and Obstruction of Justice. Gair has vehemently denied all charges, asserting that they’re fabrications.\n\nThe controversy has split the nation, sparking debates among intellectuals in universities and clashes between rioters and political hooligans in city streets. The Melbourne Stock Exchange reflects the turmoil, experiencing a continuous freefall amid the instability.\n\nThe American populace will not tolerate the endless continued clashes for much longer. In order to prevent the country from slipping into violence not seen since the Bonus Brigade Crisis, either Congress or Gair must act quickly and effectively to manage both the people and the Impeachment trial. The nation teeters on the edge, awaiting resolution amidst a sea of uncertainty and discontent.\n\nImpeachment Progress - [?AME_Impeachment_Progress|%C0] \n\nPublic Outrage - [?AME_Public_Outrage|%O0]"
