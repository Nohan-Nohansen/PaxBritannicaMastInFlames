  RUS_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YRussia§! is the undisputed hegemony in Eurasia in 1933.\n\nRussia has by far seen better days. Though a victor of the Great War this has ultimately amounted into minor gains in the form of territorial expansions. Unlike the then once believed idea that the war was some how going to fix the Russian bear's issues, this was false and folly.\n\nThe incompetent Tsar as a result had retreated into a life of solitude, blaming all his failures on his once considered allies. Though there is still hope for the Russian people, With the Tsar now slowly dying a painiful death the political sphere has begun to shift, everyday a figure of great importance to the Tsar goes missing, a position in government is changed, and one less loyal individual gains power. All know what the outcome will be for the Tsar in the coming days, alive or not.\n\nTime will tell if Russia will once again ascend into glory or fall and crumble like many have before her.\n\nRussia is a §YMajor Power§!."

  PB_RUS_Two_Alexanders:0 "A Tale of Two Alexanders"
  PB_RUS_Two_Alexanders_desc:0 "Russian history is a constant tug of war between reform and reaction, and this is most acutely felt with the last two Tsars of the Empire. Alexander II is, at least in contemporary times, viewed as a Second Peter the Great. His son, on the other hand, is viewed far less favorably.\n\nAlexander II's reforms, spurred on by his failed assassination, laid the groundwork for Russia's ascendance to global superpower status. His patronage of Nikola Tesla lead to Russia developing an overnight high technology industrial sector, and transformed the Imperial Military into a modern fighting force able to project Russian power anywhere in Eurasia.\n\nAlexander III, while he attempted to continue his father's reforms, found himself caught in the whirlwind of the Great War. The Butchered Victory was ultimately laid at his feet, and the National Rebellions of the 1920s destroyed his credibility. The exact sequence of events in the court that lead to his abdication are not, and may never be, known, but they culminating in his son Michael ascending the throne as Tsar Michael II.\n\nMichael has been pragmatic enough to continue the reforms of his forebears, perhaps hoping that standing on the shoulders of giants will once again lead Russia to greatness."
  PB_RUS_Russian_Twilight:0 "Butchered Victory"
  PB_RUS_Russian_Twilight_desc:0 "The Russian Empire was a critical frontline in the Great War, fighting across Siberia, Korea, Manchuria and Sakhalin. Combat in the Siberian campaign was brutal, and statistics indicate that most soldiers survived barely a few hours into deployment. Japanese forces made the Empire pay for every last inch, with a fanatical resistance and ingenuity that often invalidated Russia's technological advantage. Victory only came with the Third Battle of Busan, an eight month siege that left 80,000 Russian soldiers dead.\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that the terms of the Treaty of Tours were a shock to the Russian people. Russia kept almost none of her wartime gains, save Sakhalin and a few minor gains across Asia. Russia earned no colonies, Korea remained de-facto independent, and the unofficial occupation of Manchuria was to end immediately.\n\nIn a single penstroke, Britain and Germany drove a knife into the back of their Russian allies, and have spent the last twenty years rubbing salt in the open wound."
  PB_RUS_Hope_For_Future:0 "The Caesarean Section of Democracy"
  PB_RUS_Hope_For_Future_desc:0 "Democracy is often a time honored institution, treasured by the people and fought for with reckless abandon.\n\nHow then, does one bring democracy to an autocracy?\n\nThe answer, of course, depends on who you ask. In Russia, the democratic experiment has been an exercise in tension. Political parties have formed, split, and disbanded in the time it takes to finish lunch. Anarchists and nationalists engage in fistfights in the streets. Anywhere you look, you can strike sparks with the right look or the right words.\n\nFor many nations, the birth of democracy is a slow, delicate process.\n\nFor Russia, thus far it has been a bloody and violent and in many cases humiliating. In the end, though, it will be worth the pain.\n\n§RAssuming that the democratic experiment succeeds, of course.§!"
  PB_RUS_Middle_Class_Rising:0 "Rise of the Russian Middle Class"
  PB_RUS_Middle_Class_Rising_desc:0 "One of the biggest demograghic shifts of the Second Renaissance was the birth of the Russian middle class. For most of its' history, Russia was a country of haves and have-nots, with very little in between. As the industrial sector developed, however, the power of the nobility and the landowners was increasingly undermined by a growing caste of moderately wealthy former peasants.\n\nThese people would form the foundation of a middle class that would grow and mature to rival Russia's historic interest groups, and form the foundations for the rise of democracy. With industry came stable jobs, and with stable jobs came stable homes, and from that came the need for education, literacy, higher education, and intellectualism.\n\nThe middle class now forms the backbone of Russia's burgeoning political scene, and they will tenaciously defend their gains if need be."

  Russian_Assassination_Attempt.1.d:0 "It was hard to hear a portable radio over the sound of the crowd; an instrumental jazz tune hummed in one ear. She paid close attention to the notes, the warbling of the bass section, the trumpets blaring. As it all slowed to a close, an announcer with a thick Polish accent chimed in. It wasn’t the typical announcer, who at the moment was tied up in a broom closet.\n\n“Good morning, listeners. The time is eight AM. For those attending the parade this morning, the weather service has advised carrying a parasol due to the chance of rain. Don’t touch that dial now listeners, we’re just getting started with today’s catalogue-“\n\nKasandra flicked the radio off and dug her hands into her coat pockets, one hand withdrawing an old half burnt photograph. Two dirty looking children and their mother on a farm, smiling in squalor, faces distorted by melted film. The mother’s face was all but obscured by the charring; Kasandra couldn’t remember what she looked like.\n\nIn a few moments she was near the head of the crowd. The Tsar was off the podium, all smiles and shaking hands. A few nervous looking security agents orbited around him and shooed off the odd heckler. She made her way through the throng of people slowly, casually, pretending to try and get a better look. After a moment, she was within ten feet, the perfect distance.\n\nAs the Tsar made his way past, she casually slipped her hand into her pocket once more and withdrew a pistol. Seconds felt like hours now, adrenaline saturating as the sights leveled. One of the officers spotted her, sprinting towards the Tsar. Michael only had the briefest moment to glance at the commotion, eyes meeting the barrel of a gun. It was as if time stopped at that exact instant; an emperor faced with a peasant’s pistol. There wasn’t time to duck, all Michael could do was watch dumbfounded.\n\nOne barely audible prayer escaped the woman’s lips before she pulled the trigger.\n\n"God, please.""

  PB_RUS_Okhrana_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe so-called §YFirst National Awakening§! ended in the defeat of the nationalist forces, yet for many the wars of independence never ended. Across the Ukraine, Poland, the Baltics, and Finland nationalist forces continue to struggle against Russian rule. Combating this is the §YDepartment for Protecting the Public Security and Order§!, colloquially known as the §YOkhrana§! or Guard Department. Previously just the state security apparatus of the Empire, the Okhrana was expanded dramatically following the Nationalist Rebellions to combat the remnant rebel forces.\n\nThe Okhrana is reliant on resources provided §Ymonthly§!; these resources must be used carefully to target and eliminate key figures in the secessionist movements to reduce their power. Additional §Ymonthly resources§! can be acquired by expanding Okhrana operations centers; however, these will require a large initial investment before becoming operational.\n\nOur goal is the §rdecapitation§! of rebel leadership, however eliminating leaders of rebel factions may drive them in different ideological directions and lead to other figures assuming command of the movement. A rebel group is §Yonly§! fully defeated once §Yall§! the most noteworthy members of their leadership are liquidated.\n\nIf the Okhrana fails to control the power of a rebel group, there may be §rdrastic§! consequences if they perceive us to be weak or distracted.\n\nCurrently, the Okhrana has access to £RUS_Okhrana_Resources §G[?RUS.RUS_Okhrana_Resources]§! resources\n\n§YPolish Resistance Power:§!
