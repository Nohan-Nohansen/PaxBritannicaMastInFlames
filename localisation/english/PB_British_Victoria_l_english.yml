   PB_VIC_Legacy_Victory_desc:0 "Our Commenwealth was build with the blood of our sons. Despite all hardships we endured and showed the world that we are not just some miners on the other side of the world. When the French came we did not lay down our arms. We straved in the trenches of Townsville, we ambushed in the Outback, we liberated Fitzroy and destroyed the enemy in Brisbane. The has cost us so much and the wounds will never heal again. Because of that we must always be ready for danger as the tragedy of what happened here in the Great War can not repeat again."
