 news.1.t:0 "BLOODY MONDAY"
 news.1.d:0 "In an unprecedented display of force and brutality, Oceanian soldiers unleashed a hail of gunfire, claiming the lives of thirteen individuals and leaving countless others wounded in what some have grimly dubbed as ‘Bloody Monday’. This lethal response was instigated, according to army authorities, by what they deemed as provocative acts from the protestors, coupled with allegations of armed protestors targeting Oceanian troops. The military has swiftly pointed fingers at the People's Front of Aotearoa, a faction of Maori insurgents who have fervently championed independence since the aftermath of the Second Great War. However, this assertion has garnered little credence among Aotearoans, serving instead to rally significant public support for the PFA, a group steadfast in their mission to dismantle British Imperialism. It appears that a turbulent and violent path lies ahead for the future of Aotearoa."

 news.2.d:0 "In a swift and vengeful reprisal, the People's Front of Aotearoa unleashed a wave of bombings targeting several locations often visited by members of the 2nd Jet Trooper Battalion, the culprits behind last month's atrocities. Among these attacks, the most devastating were the strikes on the battalion's headquarters and the popular pubs frequented by its members. Tragically, the resulting explosions have caused numerous deaths, marking the first time Oceanian civilians have fallen victim to an PFA attack. In response, the Holland Ministry has declared its intent to dismantle the organization, already escalating troop deployments in the region. They have pledged to quell all forms of violence in the area. It appears that Oceania's patience has reached its limits."

 news.3.d:0 "In a shocking and abhorrent act of violence, the Anglo Volunteer Force targeted a place that was once deemed a sanctuary from the conflict. Te Kotuku, a primary school nestled in the heart of Tamaki, fell victim to a horrifying act of terror; tragically, the youngest victim was a mere two years old. In response to this heinous atrocity, the Oceanian government has officially labeled the AVF as a terrorist organization, set to be dismantled much like the PFA. Across the globe, people grieve for the loss of these innocent children, marking this day as one of the darkest in the Troubles."

 news.4.d:0 "Lewis Battenberg, one of the most illustrious figures in the former British Empire, has succumbed to yet another wave of PFA terrorist assaults on the nation of Oceania. He stood as one of the most esteemed men on the continent, able to trace his lineage back to the Emperors and Empresses of Germany and Great Britain. However, his noble heritage could not shield him from the terrorists' onslaught while he was on a boating excursion with his daughter and her fiancé aboard his ship, Shadow V. According to sources within the Oceanian government, a Maori crew member known as Tama Mahana discreetly placed a jelly bomb infused with nitroglycerin into the ship's hull. Foreign dignitaries from around the globe have extended their condolences for the Oceanian people's grievous loss. Even as far as London, reports have surfaced of individuals mourning the passing of one of Britain’s greatest statesmen during one of its darkest hours."

 news.5.d:0 "In a surprising show of goodwill, the Oceanian government and the PFA have opted for negotiations. Even more astounding, this dialogue with the terrorists has yielded an agreement; they have pledged to disarm over the next five years. In return, the government will ensure the safety of Maori neighborhoods and work towards ending the discrimination they often face. Nevertheless, not everyone is content with the accord. Many within the National Party and British Remnants denounce the treaty as 'the demise of English culture in Aotearoa' and a 'betrayal to the martyrs who perished fighting these terrorists'. Despite the dissent, it appears the path to peace remains on course."

 news.6.d:0 "As the year draws to a close, the people of Oceania are contemplating the future of their nation. The focal point of this election revolves around the ongoing conflict in Aotearoa. The National Party advocates for the complete eradication of the PFA, pushing for their expulsion from Aotearoa. In contrast, the incumbent Labor Party champions a stance of peace and seeks negotiations with the PFA. This approach was initially set in motion with their 'Road to Peace Initiative,' which commenced over a year ago with the Brisbane Agreement. Given their adept handling of the Aotearoa crisis over the past year, the Labor Party is anticipated to secure victory. Nevertheless, the National Party has received backing from the British Remnants, who insist that supporting the National Party is the sole acceptable choice, asserting that 'the Oceanian people must reject the Jacobins of the Labor Party.' Irrespective of the outcome, the election is poised to be fiercely contested, and its ramifications may not be confined to Oceania alone, but could reverberate throughout the entire region."

 news.7.d:0 "In a stunning turn of events, the National Party, initially considered the underdogs in this year's elections, have secured a historic victory, unseating the incumbent Labor Party. This triumph is widely attributed to the substantial pledges made by the party, coupled with the generous financial backing from the British Remnants. The populace are overwhelmingly pleased with this outcome, particularly in light of one of the party's most widely circulated and well-received promises — the dismantling of the PFA and the cessation of the Labor Party's policy of appeasement. Furthermore, there are expectations for increased funding to the military, and ambitious plans are underway to collaborate with Russia and America in containing Japanese Jacobinism in Oceania. It appears that Oceania is poised for a promising future."

 news.8.d:0 "The Labor Party has once again emerged victorious, maintaining their majority in the Oceanian Parliament. This success is attributed to the revelation of corruption within the National Party ranks and their pledges for peace with the PFA. The Labor Party took its first steps toward fulfilling this promise nearly two years ago with the establishment of the 'Road to Peace Initiative,' and it seems they are poised to build upon it by expediting the disarmament of the PFA and advancing Maori rights nationwide. However, all is not smooth sailing, as the British Remnants, who had pinned their hopes on a Nationalist victory, have denounced the results as illegitimate and accused Walter Nash and his government of being puppets of foreign powers. It appears that Oceania must weather one more storm before achieving lasting peace and prosperity."

 news.9.d:0 "Reports have emerged from Oceania detailing an audacious coup attempt orchestrated by members of the British Remnants, with backing from the National Party. Exploiting their ties within the military, the British Remnants launched an assault on several government facilities, cloaked in the rhetoric of 'rescuing Oceanian democracy from the Jacobin threat'. Fortunately, the majority of military forces remained loyal to Fritzroy, with Nash swiftly mobilizing troops to besiege the city and retake the compromised offices. In the aftermath, the Nash Ministry took decisive action, purging all vestiges of the British Remnants from both the government and society at large. It appears the last bastion of the British Empire has had enough of the British."

 news.10.d:0 "News has filtered in from Oceania, revealing that the British Remnants, leveraging their sway over both the military and the National Party, have overthrown the Nash Ministry, establishing a draconian military regime in its stead. Public outrage has erupted swiftly, with citizens from both Oceania and Aotearoa vehemently denouncing this unlawful power grab. Regrettably, the British Remnants have initiated a ruthless crackdown on all forms of dissent, deploying landships and automats to quell protests. The fledgling regime has wasted no time in positioning itself as a bulwark against what it deems 'a rising tide of socialism across Asia'. It appears the lion has set its sights on the sun."

 news.11.d:0 "With their newly established regime now firmly established on the home front, Oceania's gaze has turned outward, particularly towards their Jacobin neighbors across the waves. In a compelling feat of oratory, Robert Muldoon, once an obscure figure in Oceanian politics, has skillfully woven a narrative framing their assumption of power as a revolution against the encroaching Jacobin forces that encircle the nation. He highlighted the flow of Japanese munitions into the hands of Aotearoan insurgents and cast doubt on Walter Nash, suggesting he was a Jacobin operative providing intel to Tokyo. According to Muldoon, the nation required a radical response, and the British Remnants stepped forward to shatter the shackles of socialism. Now, he declared, the time had come for a crusade against the scourge of Jacobinism, with Oceania poised to lead the charge. Despite this masterful rhetorical display, it remains uncertain whether other nations will heed this call; nonetheless, Oceania appears resolute in its opposition to Jacobinism, allocating substantial resources to the formation of an expeditionary force capable of containing Jacobin forces in East Asia."

With the dissolution of the British Remnants, whose attempt at a coup was swiftly thwarted by the Labor Party, a lasting tranquility has been achieved with the People’s Front of Aotearoa. The PFA has relinquished all weapons, while the Labor government has pledged an unwavering commitment to equality throughout the nation. There is a newfound sense of vitality in the air, as Aotearoa can finally cast aside the memories of bombings, shootings, and the once prevalent violence. Children can now grow up without ever knowing the harrowing sound of bullets piercing the air. Peace stands as the ultimate aspiration for all of humanity; and Aotearoa should be the model for all nations."

 news.13.d:0 "It appears that Oceania will not escape punishment for the atrocities committed on what has become known worldwide as 'Black Friday.' During a state visit to Israel, Tom Macdonald, Oceania's foreign minister, met his demise in an brazen attempt to strengthen ties with America and other League of Nations nations. The People’s Front of Aotearoa clandestinely infiltrated his hotel room and planted a timed explosive on his desk. Alongside Macdonald, two other aides fell victim to the blast and succumbed to their injuries at a nearby hospital. Despite the global shockwaves, public outcry has been relatively subdued, still overshadowed by the mourning for those lost to Oceanian gunfire on Black Friday. Regrettably, Macdonald's passing has not propelled Aotearoa any closer to independence, as Tamaki remains in ruins after the fateful event."

 news.14.d:0 "In an act of unprecedented brutality, surpassing even the horrors of Bloody Monday nearly three years prior, the Oceanian government, aided by right-wing Anglo militants, systematically cleared Tamaki, a stronghold of the PFA, employing every available means in their formidable arsenal. Images of the atrocity have reverberated across the globe, with many dubbing this the most devastating day of the Troubles, 'Black Friday'. The final death toll is estimated to be in the hundreds, as the Oceanian military unleashed everything from hardsuits to artillery to expel the PFA. These ruthless measures achieved their objective; the once formidable PFA, which had once struck fear into the hearts of Oceanian security forces, has been brought to the brink of extinction, with only a handful of leaders managing to evade capture and flee to Tokyo. The PFA has sworn to seek retribution for the injustices inflicted upon the Aotearoan people today. Yet, it is difficult to fathom how a group on the brink of annihilation could ever muster the strength to contend with the might of the Oceanian military."
