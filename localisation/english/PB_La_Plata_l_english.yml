  PB_ARG_Fading_Triumverate:0 "The Fading Triumverate"
  PB_ARG_Fading_Triumverate_desc:0 "The Triumverate is an unofficial term used to describe the ascendancy of La Plata, Cisplatina and the Andine Federation in the aftermath of Brazil's collapse. With Brazil having ceased to exist as a state, these nations were the primary beneficiaries of the exodus of Brazilian businesses and intellectuals. The power bloc, seeking to consolidate and cement their status, established a series of mutual agreements at the Congress of Buenos Aires.\n\nThough a mix diplomacy and interventionism, the three powers were able to maintain a period of relative stability in South America. That period, however, was a long time ago. The once close alliance has moldered into little more than a series of trade agreements and begrudging guarantees. The delicate concert that the South American powers once played has become disharmonic, and it may only take one more bum note to bring the whole thing down."
