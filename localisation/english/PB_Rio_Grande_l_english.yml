  PB_RGD_Rio_Grande_Fruits_desc:0 "The Rio Grande River runs through several areas of the Republic, and the water supplied by the river is absolutely vital to the nation's agricultural base. Though there is some tension with Tejas over who truly controls the Rio Grande, post-revolution treaties have granted some degree of control to us over the ports where the Rio Grande lets out into the Gulf. However, the heavy reliance on agriculture has lead to a slower industrialization in the Republic's interior."
  PB_RGD_Resistance_to_Centralization:0 "Resistance to Centralization"
  PB_RGD_Resistance_to_Centralization_desc:0 "The Riograndese Constitution enshrines the autonomy of local governments, largely as a response to the centralist provincial policies of the Empire which sparked the Republic's declaration of independence. Though this policy has greatly empowered provincial governors, allowing for flexible domestic policy, it has lead to a disfunctional military largely composed of provincial militias. Many provincial governors resist our efforts to centralize the government, but it may be necessary to defend ourselves against outside threats."
