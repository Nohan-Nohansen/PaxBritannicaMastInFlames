  PB_WAF_White_Oasis:0 "White Oasis of the Sahara"
  PB_WAF_White_Oasis_desc:0 "The establishment of the Green Sahara project stood on the shoulders of people like Rudyard Kipling and Edmund Etchegoyen, modern pioneers in the concept of White Man's Burden. Through these ideas, the concept of turning the Sahara from uncivilized wasteland of tribes and clans to modern pearls on equal footing with London and Frankfurt was born. Through the use of several canals, connecting the Mediterranean and Atlantic Oceans to lower depressions in the Sahara, the new lakes of Africa were given form to. \n\nSince the initial development of these new seas, settlements around the coasts have been formed through combined state and industrial effort. While initially just meant for settlement, the cities on the seas turned into a luxurious mix of Mediterranean, German and Anglo-Saxon styles, a testament to European unity and the founding myth of White Man's Burden. From there, the pictoresque cities of New Alexandria, Rhodes City and Francisland turned into tourism hotspots. Thousands of rich Europeans come here to tan in the hot Sahara sun, enjoy the mild climate pockets around the seas or abuse the relaxed local laws to experiment with genetics, bio-engineering and drugs. With our strong industry of tourism, Carnegia props up the continued expansion of its civilizing mission around the New African Seas."
  PB_WAF_Native_Reservation_Zones:0 "Rhodesian Paternalism Act of '91"
  PB_WAF_Native_Reservation_Zones_desc:0 "Created through the excessive influence of Sir Cecil Rhodes on the Carnegian project, the Rhodesian Paternalism Act was the legislative legacy left behind by the elderly Rhodes before he died in 1894 on his estate outside of Rhodes City. Embodying his view on the native and imported labour people as \"children, deemed unworthy of the franchise until civilised\", the Act has been the foundational basis of Carnegia's ethnic segregation. Outside of the colonial luxury of the coastal cities, ghettos and slums dominate the rural deserts. Home to the native Maghrebi people and the imported labour people, ranging from Han Chinese and Vietnamese to Bantu and Mestizo Hispanics, the \"Cecil Slums\" house the absolute majority of Carnegia's population, stripped from any civil or political right and separated from the lap of luxury represented in the colonial cities. \n\nIt is perhaps this despiceable situation that worries most white Carnegian natives. The unfair balance of power remains intact with the laws that build upon this Rhodesian paternalist view of the native people, yet the natives are those that keep the colony afloat. The bountiful food, the construction of new hotels and the logistical operation of running a tourism industry: all falls on the non-European people. Can a system as exploitative as this sustain itself for the long-term, or will serious reform be needed to conclude Rhodes' civilising mission?"
