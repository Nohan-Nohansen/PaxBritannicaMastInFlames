 PB_Anarchy_wild_west_tt_delayed: "Something is out there, amongst the cold skies of the Great American plains. Little is known of those that live there and even less is known of the states that call these lands home. While trade and infrastructure networks have long been established little effort has been made to civilize these lands. But recent attempts by the United Commonwealth and the remnants of the Mexican Empire have been semi-successful to map out the last bastion of the American Wild West, but some would rather not poke around to see what sleeping giant comes running out, if any that is.\n\n§RIts a Wild World out there, and its best if its left that way.§!"
