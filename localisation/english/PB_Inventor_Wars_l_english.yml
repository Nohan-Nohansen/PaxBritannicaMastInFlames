  inventorwar.1.t:0 "The Child of Light"
  inventorwar.1.d:0 "The Edison Imperial Electric Exposition was a place not known for tact or subtlety.\n\nEnormous plasticine lightbulbs flanked each side of a vast stage, while showgirls twirled about beneath the flickering bulbs of the press corps. Scandelously clad waitresses toured through the crowd, handing out cocktails and cigars to the backing of a booming live jazz band. Amidst it all, at center stage, stood arguably one of the most powerful men on Earth.\n\nCharles Edison flashed the crowd a smile, piping cigar in hand as an aide handed him a microphone, and for just the briefest moment it seemed the whole world stopped for him alone. The band eased down, the crowd went quiet, a single light shown down on the stage.\n\n\"Now folks, I gotta tell ya, was that not the most fantastic show on telescreen?\"\n\nA pause for the applause, naturally.\n\n\"See though, the glitz and the glam, that's not what this company is really about. It's about building a better future, today. We are, in the year of our lord nineteen thirty three, on the verge of things thought impossible a hundred years ago. We've banished want across the entire Sahara Green Belt, we've bridged the world with the telescreen, but it's important to never lose sight of the most important thing, and that's changing lives.\"\n\nEdison, letting his smile drop for a moment, glanced over the crowd. He had them on the line, and now all he needed was to reel em' in.\n\n\"I've brought on a very special guest to speak with all of you tonight, and I hope her words will affect you as much as they've affected me. She's one of the greatest success stories of the modern era, a woman dealt one of the worst hands you've ever seen, but she's perservered, and thanks to this company's advancements in hearing and sight implants, she'll be able to live a life far beyond the deal god gave her. I'd like to invite to the stage Miss Helen Keller!\"\n\nFrom the backstage emerged an aged woman, dressed simply and waving to the gathered press. Edison surrendered the stage, handing off the mic to Keller and standing back to watch his best advertisement sell augments like hotcakes. Just to be safe, though, he made sure the cameras got a good view of the ocular implants. He needed to get his money's worth out of that tech, lord knows the R&D costs alone nearly bankrupted a few departments. Could you really put a price on curing blindness, though?"

  inventorwar.2.t:0 "The Child of Darkness"
  inventorwar.2.d:0 "If you were to look at Teslagrad, you might think it little more than a moldering industrial park, increasingly buried in the dust of the Central Asian Uplands. The unassuming ruins, one might think, were just the leftovers of an oil refinery or perhaps a military outpost. One would be forgiven for not knowing that at one point, this was a place where wonders were born.\n\nNikola Tesla, the man who created the modern world, was pulling up cabbages. The scruffy, shuffling elderly man hardly resembled the man who had ushered in the Second Renaissance. All the virulence had seemingly been struck out of him and like a shivering automaton, he pulled up cabbages and quietly tossed them in a basket. All around him stood monoliths, vast research labs packed with equipment that had cost billions, and all of it left to dry rot in the Kazakh sun. The crumbling buildings seemed to watch him, silently judging him with cracked glass window eyes, and the wind carried the whispers of his own self hatred. There was hardly a second that went by where he had peace and his mind wasn't flooded with terrible thoughts, screams, cries. Every day he stared at the noose he'd put up in his office and every day he called himself a coward when he couldn't kick the chair.\n\nFrom a makeshift dinner table, Tesla took in a bowl of cold cabbage soup and a glass of milk. He did this same routine each afternoon, each day, for the last decade. Cabbage and milk was the only thing he could bring himself to eat anymore, anything else, anything the Tsar's men had brought him, he couldn't touch. Immaculately produced cakes and caviar, all left to rot in a fridge somewhere because all he saw in it was blood, intestines and scorched skin. He was a prisoner, just as much to his mind as to Moscow, even if now he was little more than some fetid curiosity to be discussed in the tabloids. His genius had been both his creator and his damnation, and now the Empire kept him captive in a velvet cage for fear he'd sell his secrets to the world.\n\nIn the end though, he had no secrets left to give, no new genius to impart. All he was now was an old man, surrounded by cabbages and pigeons and the hulking ruins of his mistakes."
  inventorwar.2.a:0 "And at least this way, he'd never hurt anyone again."
