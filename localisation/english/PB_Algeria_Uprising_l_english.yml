magman.4.t:0 "Algeria in Flames"
magman.4.d:0 "With the Algerian Uprising well under way some in our high command believe now is the time to fully assit the Pied-Noir communities in Oran with French volunteers and weapon shipments"

magman.5.t:0 "Oran Requests Annexation"

magman.5.a:0 "We will be delighted"

magman.6.t:0 "Our Moment of Oppurtunity"
magman.6.d:0 "We have been closlely following the deteriorating situation in the Maghreb Mandate and were quickly react to the Chaos in Algiers. The Rif is open and was once ours and it shall be again.\n\nThe International Community is not able to guarentee stability and peace in Ceuta-Melilla and so we shall do it. We have returned to Africa and this time we are here to stay.\n\nBut it seems like the abhorrent state to the South of us does not respect this development. Morocco was slow the realize the situation in the Maghreb and with our navy we were faster in capturing the major cities. However this does not seem to stop Casablanca. Diplomatic Relations are close to breaking up and it seems like there will be conflict.\n\nAnd conflict birthes oppurtunities."
magman.6.a:0 "The Spanish Empire Returns"

magman.7.t:0 "The Spanish Land in Ceuta!"
magman.7.d:0 "The Spanish have landed in Ceuta-Merilla and taken control over the major cities!\n\nThey claim that they are only there to guarentee the safety and stability of the Rif but we all know it is a lie. The people in our Rif are our people and were expecting us to safeguard them! This nothing else but another attempt of colonialisation by the Spanish.\n\nAnd let us not fool ourselves. They will not be satified with just Ceuta. The indepedence of our nation is again at stake!"
magman.7.a:0 "This means War!"

magman.8.t:0 "Morocco is Mobilizing!"
magman.8.d:0 "The Army of Morocco is mobilizing. Conscription is being introduced and their economy gears for war. The local tribal leaders in the Rif declare rebellion to our rule.\n\nIt seems like they want to solve the Rif Question with war. Let them come. They will not stand a chance and we will get the justification to march on Casablanca and take all of Morocco.\n\nHowever public support for a war right now is not the best and we are not fully ready. We can not endavour a long war and if would lose Ceuta-Merilla the public would turn against us and force us to end the war."
magman.8.a:0 "Let us settle this. Once and for all."

magman.9.t:0 "Our Last War!"
magman.9.d:0 "Our Armies are ready, our people are praying and the sun is shining.\n\nThis will the last war Morocco will ever have to fight. The last war to free our people from the colonizers. The last war to guarentee our independence. The last war our children have to endure."

magman.10.t:0 "Exploiting Morroco's Misfortune?"
magman.10.d:0 "Spain has taken Casablanca and seems like that the rest of Moroccon Resistance will soon crumcle. Their army is broken and there not even border guards on the few posts in the south.\n\nPoliticians are now demanding that we take the oppurtunity of this situation and take control of Rio de Oro and Reguibat. If Spain takes over all of Morocco they would at the doors of New Alexandria, a risk we can not really take.\n\nHowever 13 Years ago we guarenteed the current borders of Morocco after the brutal war in Morocco and promised to respect them. Should we not rather send more support to Morocco?"
magman.10.a:0 "The Spanish can not control these lands!"
magman.10.b:0 "We should rather support Morocco in their fight."
