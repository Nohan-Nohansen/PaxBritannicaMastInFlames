 #British Federation Ideas
 
 OBR_Operation_Eleanor:0 "Legacy of Operation Eleanor"
 OBR_Operation_Eleanor_desc:0 "Britannia lay vanquished, trampled by the french boots. Even the waves which one kept us safe away from the turmoils of the continent couldn’t prevent the very sky crashing on us. While our fierce aramada may have demolished the opponent’s fleet on numerous occasions, no battleships nor cruisers could have stopped this onslaught from above... And below. Deep under the sea, the french sea-wolves were already an issue by themselves, preying upon civilian vessels and lone warships alike. Little did we knew Russian sorcery would transfigure these silent predators into Leviathans of some sort. With uranium-fuelled electromagnetic catapults to propell their doomsday weapons and long-range communication to instruct these deadly devices, the french plundged their dagger directly into our land. Cluster bombs and incendiary missiles would rain on our cities days and nights, all coordinated through the Tsar’s new realm in orbit. As everything was already burning, then came the cherubs: highly-armoured, yet agile, drones of terror directly sent through the air. Clearing their paths with their flaming swords, these angels of death instructed from Paradise itself would kill any semblance of remaining hope within our people’s mind. At the end, the only thing that was left was our will to end this nightmare at all cost. Operation Eleanor had succeeded, but neither us nor the french knew the true consequences of it at this time. \n\nDecades after the conflagration’s end, the magnitude of the devastation still weigh upon our economy and people alike, forcing even the hateful froggies to intervene in our favour. Charred by the bombardment, the land has barely recovered due to international aids being constantly seized by unscrupulous bureaucrats and military warlords. As if material poverty wasn’t already harsh enough, our very minds has succumbed to apathy and resignation -fear of the sky even becoming a common symptom diagnosed in new traumas-. \n\nIt seems our will to fight has truly been shattered by Operation Eleanor’s infamous legacy."
 OBR_Victorianism_ends:0 "An End to Victoranism?"
 OBR_Victorianism_ends_desc:0 "The catastrophe brought by the Second Great War didn’t manifested only in our country proper. On all continents, british failure to contain the forces of this so-called Pact of Thorns created a vacuum soon filled by the uncivilized and opportunists we kept at bay all this time. From the fertile estuary of the Nile up to the Great Borealian North and the deep jungles of Bengale, our once splendid empire crumbled and vanished almost overnight. The madmen in Africa may grumble against it from fiery declarations to delirious speeches, the truth is well-known among our peoples: the past-days are gone for good. \n\nNonetheless, has Victorianism truly died with the disappearance of Victoria herself, or does the british spirit still lives under another shape? Nebulas of new parties, secret societies and think-tanks has formed in the past decades with the firm intention to answer this dreadful question. If many of these movements may not have survived the repression inflicted both by moral policing -ironically enough, a product of Victorianism itself- and french-backed State surveillance, the constant flow of ideas coming from the East and West alike keep filling peoples’ heads with visions and ideals for a new Britain. It’s only a matter of time before these burgeoning hopes may blossom into concrete and organized actions in favour -or more certainly against- us."
 OBR_Fed_act:0 "1944' Act of Federation"
 OBR_Fed_act_desc:0 "Along monetary compensation and establishment of their occupation zones on our soil, the french imposed us a new constitution under false pretexts of safeguarding British people’s freedom and -more importantly- curtailling any dissents caused by the empire crumbling apart. Ironically enough, elements of our previous Imperial Federation’s legal frame retrofitted for our sole Nation-State has caused our very demise. Taking inspiration from the dominion status previously used for our overseas possessions, this new national legislation enshrine british nations’ increased autonomy, effectively turning our union into a loose federation of decentralized bodies instead. The administrative imbroglio born from it is sufficient enough to neutralize most attempts in correcting our current course: with every constituents getting their own militias and jurisdictions, coordinating any semblance of general recovery is doomed to fail. Difference in tax-collection, infrastructural management or even economical goals drains our scarce ressources and constrain to inefficiency due to duplicated efforts, overlapping projects and petty rivalries. \n\nThis Act of Federation might have been a peverted attempt in undermining british unity, but the french still knows where to set the limit. More than a united Britannia, the perspective of complete regional independence which could cascade out of control frighten more Paris as it fears such a state of affair could give wrong ideas to its own regional entities. While this prospect is unlikely to happen for now, the simple idea of it allows us to keep the boat afloat with the blessing of France itself."
 OBR_Forgotten_corner:0 "Forgotten Corner of the World"
 OBR_Forgotten_corner_desc:0 "Previously resplendent on the world stage, Britannia now appears as nothing but a rump-state compared to its past imperial form. This enormous decline discredited us at a level so high it seems the world ceased to care about those who were once the center of everything. Eager to carefully manage us the first years after its unfortunate triumph, France nows barely aknowledge our existence, more concerned by their nascent rivalry with the Tsar and their possessions along the Rhine than keeping us in line. Despite increased concern for the Northern Seas, the Russian Empire still prefer to deal with the now-independent Scotts than those they perceive as a mere sub-state of the french nation. Having choose to cut themselves out of Europe for good, our once-subservients american bretherens consider us with little interest while the sino-japanese barbarians appears more preoccupied by our Australian remnants than ourselves. It is like we faded out of the grand tapestry of things, left on the side of the road while the wheel of History continued to move without us on top of it. \n\nAs humiliating as it might seem, it appears being reduced to so little on the international stage isn’t entirely negative as one could have thought. As long as we don’t threaten their precious occupation zones and this godamn federation they imposed upon us, the french let us prety much free to trade with whoever but the Tsar. With a bit of carefulness, it might even be possible to establish unofficial relationships with nations even deemed opposed to the french’s interests."

 #Valentia March Ideas
 
 MIF_VMA_Antonine_n_Hadrian:0 "Between Antonine and Hadrian"
 MIF_VMA_Antonine_n_Hadrian_desc:0 "To the North, the scotts. To the South, the anglos. Like an island above dangerous waters, Valentia find itself surrounded by rivals seeking its demise. Once only conceived as a buffer against the nascent Scottish Republic, the Valentia march now find itself at odd with Birmingham as well. Loosely controlled by Paris, the British Federation doesn’t even hide its motivation, openly claiming our land and lobbying the french in that regard. Under normal circumstences, their demands would already have been satisfied, and our administration dismantled as a result. And yet, we stand as the sole obstacle preventing Scotland and England from meeting again. The terrible prospect of a potential reunion of both -or worse, Glasgow sowing the seeds of regional nationalism within the weakened Federation- justify our garrison’s continuous existence as a buffer-State. \n\nOne can only wonders if we will whistand the outsiders like the Antonine and Hadrian walls of the old, or succumb to the barbarians instead."
 MIF_VMA_Auto_admin:0 "Autonomous Administration"
 MIF_VMA_Auto_admin_desc:0 "While Valentia itself may appears as the bizarre product of militaristic zealotry forced to compromise with geopolitical pragmatism, even stranger is the way this territory that shouldn’t be is actually administered. The paradoxical situation of this country -a land to be necessarily occupied to keep local nationalists at bay, yet one that should also be released as it demands far too much ressources the overlord can allocates- led the french toward a solution as radical as it was esoteric. In the same fashion some of the EEIC-run industries already experienced full-scale automation prior to the war, Valentia would be turned from a trivial but unsunstainable occupation zone into the first machine-rune territory in History. Thanks to recovered EEIC’s assets througout the now-vanquished Britain, France was quick to set up this experimentation as it was eager to focus on continental Europe instead. \n\nSurprisingly enough, this new, synthetic way of governance turned out to be far more efficient than some could have thought beforehand, even challenging or surpassing conventional administrations in that regard. From automated surveillance to adaptative security protocols and even self-evolving infrastructures, humans operators plays little role in running the local affairs. As the last breakthroughs in constructed intelligence offer the promise of a completely self-sufficient system, the local populace finds itself increasingly at odd with its mechanical overlord. While the french nominally oversees the region, the diminishing numbers of their bureaucrats on ground leaves the natives with the impression that the machines are indeed reigning unopposed. More disturbing are the gossips surrounding some troubling disappearances and so-called accidents involving some of the automatons. \n\nIt is to see if this autonomous administration constitutes the final-stage in empire-building, or embodies the very demise of mankind instead."
 
 #Republic of Scotland Ideas#
 
 SCO_Northern_star:0 "The Northern Star"
 SCO_Northern_star_desc:0 "On 1944, we boldly seized our own destiny as Britain was falling apart. Formed overnight, a provsionnal scottish parliament declared the unilateral independence of our country as negotations of peace were still ongoing between London and Paris. In a rare moment of political unity, the unionist factions of Scotland bonded with the local nationalists as they perceived such a move could pave the road for future British reunification. While it first appeared this experimentation in nation-building wouldn’t last with the french at the door, the bravery of the scottish fighters and mountainous terrain would severly cripple Doriot’s army advance onto our soil. With the bear showing its fangs along the Oder and Paris unable to achieve quick victory, a ceasefire was negotiated between our respective countries, and the Valentia march subsequently established on our southern border as a result. Scotland had triumphed over the Latin invaders, earning the nickname of Northern Star as it remained one of the sole european nation unoccupied by the belligerents. \n\nNowadays, our Republic is still up to its reputation despite the constant threat posed by Paris’ proxies beyond the Tweed. If cracks started to show up on the wall with the unionist defection and so-called Poet’s presidency, the average scott remains eager to safeguard his homeland’s independence at all costs. This widespread attitude of resilience, reinforced by a strong economic fabric and numerous welfare programs, allow for our country to experience overall stability and prosperity despite the harsh circumstences of the post-war Order. \n\nMay the Northern Star shine bright for the centuries to come!"
 SCO_Poet_presidency:0 "The Poet’s Presidency"
 SCO_Poet_presidency_desc:0 "MacDiarmid’s long reign has been one of continuous controversies and relative stability at the same time. This strange paradox can be explained by the poet-turned-statesman charisma and ecclectic ideas, which allowed him to cement a broad coalition of nationalists and progressive elements alike. Despite his eccentric -and often provocative- behaviours, MacDiarmid’s aptitude to forge and nurture this unthinkable alliance of diverging interests granted him numerous electoral successes, consolidating the mythos around himself while sidelining his main opponents in the process. The first victim of this state of fact have been the unionist leagues, which, ousted from the ruling coalition, have since been marginalized by the ruling authorities. \n\nThis so-called "Poet’s presidency" may have been beneficial in strenghtening Scotland’s nationalism as such. Yet, it doesn’t change the fact such a long reign turned the nascent democracy into an oligarchy of some sort. While quasi-socialist welfare policies and affirmation of a distinct identity have done much in satisfying the masses, a general malaise seems to have strucked down the opposition and National Party’s moderates allies as well. From reports of paramilitary violence conducted against unionists’ militants to frequent circumvention of the main legislative bodies, it appear the Republic is turning away from the ideal of Saint-Just and Danton, into a crude parody of the Roman legal dictatorship of the old instead. \n\nAlthough the Poet’s indecision in political affairs and the wideness of his grand coalition allows for defiant associates to structure their own tendencies without much worry, it remain to be seen if such an internal opposition can effectively quell MacDiarmid’s most authoritarian leanings."
 SCO_Unionist_threat:0 "Ghosts of the Union"
 SCO_Unionist_threat_desc:0 "A Specter haunts Scotland... \n\nAmong the national opposition to MacDiarmird’s National Party, the unionist leagues assurely stands as the most prevalent and popular formation by far. More concerning however are the ideal these leagues uphold despite all odds. For the unionists are sorcerers of some sort, attempting to resurrect what was once deemed dead and burried for good: the idea of a reunion between spearated siblings. The reunification of the Isle and its nations such as the one Great Britain once achieved. Beyond this rapturous vision, ambitions diverges, and everything becomes more uncertain. That is why the leagues remains firmly committed on whats united them in first instance, much to the worry of Glasgow and the ruling nationalists. Attempts in sidelining the so-called "union imperialists" may have greatly weakened the movement within the legal institutions, but the popularity and readiness of the unionists remains all high despite these miserable schemes. \n\nFor now, both the National Party and the unionists knows they can’t fully get rid of the other as it could threaten the whole balance of the society. Yet, should the southern occupation comes to an abrupt end or the french position be altered on the international stage, such a change could very much cause this long-time rivalry to erupt into an open fight for political dominance on the country."
 SCO_Machine_threat:0 "A Mechanical Menace?"
 SCO_Machine_threat_desc:0 "The Latin scourge may have been unable to reach Glasgow and force the whole British Isle into submission. And yet, the french still occupies rightful celtic lands beyond the Tweed river, constantly keeping an eye on us through this hidious manifestation of their hubris they called "Valentia". Nonetheless, such an occupation was clearly unsustainable on the long-run, and so we first thought Paris would relinquish on its gains for the sake of avoiding military overspreading. Little did we knew Doriot’s regime had reached this point in madness. Instead of abandoning their position, the invaders devolved much of their control to soulless automatons instead. Soon, the machines revealed themselves to be far more reckless in ensuring continuous control of the region than the french were beforehand, leaving us in awe as we were denied of access to the South. This feeling of deprivation and fear never truly left our people’s psyche. One could even argue it entrenched itself instead, affecting the whole national body as a result. Such a mood have translated into generalized phobia towards anything that ressemble an automaton, with even luddism making its grand return on the political stage through certain parties. \n\nWhile it is true we don’t know much about what’s going on into Valentia, our hands will remains tied as long as this mechanical menace is not dealt with accordingly."
 
 #Isle of Man Ideas#
 
 IOM_Haven:0 "Haven on the Sea"
 IOM_Haven_desc:0 "The Isle of Man relative autonomy and strategic location between Ireland and the former Great Britain has contributed to erect the once unoticable island into a prosperous haven of political -and fiscal- freedom. In this cold land, european magnates eager to escape regulations cross the road of exiled revolutionaries and dissenters of all kinds and creeds. \n\nStrangely enough, both can sometimes reach successful agreements of the strangest type, with social revolutionaries operating as henchmen for greedy buisinessmen eager to undermine their competitors despite their diverging goals and mutual distrust. The result of those bizarre arrengements and the general blending of various populaces is a vivid and often disorderly melting-pot. A country bordering the bandit-State in some regards, and yet, remaining functional and even thriving thanks to this state of affair. The neighbors and overlords of the Isle are perfectly aware of all this, but their own corrupted bureaucrats and capitalists prevents any actions to be taken as they too are tied to the Manx homeland in a way or another."
 IOM_Joint_admin:0 "The Joint-Administration Issue"
 IOM_Joint_admin_desc:0 "A British Federation’s dependency on paper, the Isle of Man is in fact administered both by a pro-british cabinet and a french administration. This joint administration is, however, nothing short of ineffective. While Paris may think it have the upper-hand on the Isle’s governance, the reality is that the few ressources it allocates for its local forces ultimately led them to embrace corruption instead. Moreover, the very position the Manx’s homeland finds itself has allowed for the irish -and even the scotts in some regards- to meddle with internal affairs. While this complete chaos of an administration is detrimental to France’s power projection in the area, it offer a margin of maneuvers to the locals no french sattelites could ever enjoy. \n\nShould Paris or Birmingham tries to reaffirm their claim on the Isle, it would certainly triggers a violent response from the natives and surrounding powers as well."
 
 #Dover Occupation Ideas#
 
 DOC_Neverending_occupation:0 "Never-ending Occupation"
 DOC_Neverending_occupation_desc:0 "Once a symbol of victory and perserverance over the vanquished British, our occupation forces was to remain on foreign soil for some years, enough for the situation to stabilize and the world to aknowledge our newfound glory. Nonetheless, nothing had prepared our men for what would became the terrible truth: the glory never came, and the occupation never ended. First, there was London, turned from an once resplendant megapolis into a dumping ground for all of Europe to throw away their outlaws in. A completely secluded and ruined city the size of a small-country Paris couldn’t secure without the assistance of its precious garrisons. Then, there was the Dogger bank building site, and the subsequent need for military supervision over the constant flow of workers and equipments travelling from continental Europe through the sea. Moreover, the parisian bureaucrats were more than eager to use our men for purposes they were not supposed to conduct beforehand. As such, we found ourselves intervening into the surrounding regions, recovering assets or ensuring civilian order like policemen of some kind. A joke in poor taste for our peoples considering the reward for fullfilling these new missions was a continuous decrease of our allocated budget during the last years. The result of this erratic and short-sighted policy is an exhausted garrison plagued by inefficiency, with soldiers more eager to return home as soon as possible than ensuring their task are done correctly."
 DOC_Transit:0 "Transit Area Number One"
 DOC_Transit_desc:0 "The Dover occupation zone bind three landmasses together, standing as a gateway between continental Europe, the British Isles and the newly-raised Dogger bank. Such a state of affair have been mostly beneficial to the region’s economy, with merchandises flowing unrestrained through the South-eastern cities and new infrastructural works being pursued to reinforce these fluxes. Nonetheless, with this newly-found economical purpose also came a general feeling of enstrangement for the natives. While the region nows appear more closer to a country-wide passageway rather than a proper homeland one could settle in, daily arrivals of new workers from all horizons have reshaped the local culture into a frantically evolving, cosmopolitan patchwork of diverse traditions and customs. Between the french soldiers, the indian workers, the fleeing germans or the kazakh émigrés, it is indeed hard for the englishmen to makes sense of this curious -somewhat confusing- blending."
