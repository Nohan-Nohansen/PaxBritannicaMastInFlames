waroutcome.15.t:0 "The Future of Spain"
waroutcome.15.d:0 "With victory over the Spanish crusader state, it has become clear to our administrators that Spain has suffered the last few decades for want of a sovereign. Obviously the Bourbon dynasty which ruled before the Great War is out of consideration, which naturally leaves two obvious solutions. We can install a monarch from the British house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, or we can install a monarch from the House of Habsburg.\n\nBoth bring with them the natural political inclinations of their home country, with the Windsorite proposal citing the need for Spanish autonomism in the same model as the Imperial Confederation. The Habsburg proposal is more conservative, arguing for a federative Spanish kingdom with limited autonomy for the country's minority regions. The natural historical implications of returning Spain to the bosom of Vienna is fairly obvious, of course.\n\nRegardless of the decision, the League has a golden opportunity to capitalize on Spain's weariness to create a compliant nation and establish control over a critical instrument in rebuilding the European concert."

The commanders are now strongly debating pulling out of the Philippines alltogether, and leaving them be. This is now considered to be the optimal choice, as supply is running low, and morale even lower.\n\nBut what about our Empire? The Embarrasement? The Soldiers who have already died in the Philippines?... Was it all for nothing?\n\nIt might be extreme but to save the face of the Empire, Frankfurt might have to intervene in the conflict itself."
