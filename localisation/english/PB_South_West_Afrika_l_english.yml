POLITICS_Henning_von_Tresckow_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!10/01/1901\n\nA prestigious young officer and savvy charisma man scored §YHenning Von Tresckow§! a comfortable job as the garrison military head in Frankfurt. Though when colonial unrest came knocking Henning came to answer. Now seated as colonial head of German South-West Afrika (Deutsch-Südwestafrika) he must embark on the grueling task of balancing the interests of the native peoples, and the ever increasing German settlers. This will be no easy feat.\n\nWith the discovery of diamonds, gold, and copper two decades ago investment for the colony has skyrocketed to unimaginable heights. Of course with the influx of new settlers demands for new lands became an increasing issue and reignited hostilities once thought to be tamed. As always, there are more harmful threats than the local population. Up north sits the Portugese and their Middle-Afrika, down south the Dutch and their cancerous spread of dominions. And to the east sits a lonely port waving the Union Jack. And despite all this Henning is still confident that he remains the only man fit for the job. "
