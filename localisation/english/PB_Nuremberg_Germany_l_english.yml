mge.1.t:0 "The Dijon Trials"
mge.1.d:0 "The capitulation of the German empire has been a blow to the hearts of many in the former state. However, France is not done yet with its occupation. \n\nAs the French government still blames the Germans for the entire Great War and the aftermath it had on France, several high profile members of the former Ferdinand administration have been held captive till this point. The military court established in Dijon has ordered these German captives to show before court and are brought to France at this very moment for the whole world to see on television and to hear on radio."
mge.1.a:0 "The French can't have a break, can they?"
mge.2.t:0 "The Trial of Gustav Krupp"
mge.2.d:0 "Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, leader of Friedrich Krupp AG, has today shown his face in Dijon during the Dijon Trials. As the main man of the german war effort and the equipment used by the royal German army, Krupp has been marked as a French enemy of the state. The trial, which was more like a long outburst of anger on the military jury's part, ended with Gustav found guilty of the German warcrimes defined by the French state, allowing the government to seize all his wealth and forcing him into an early death. His execution will privately happen next week."
mge.2.a:0 "Interesting"
mge.3.t:0 "Krupp commits suicide"
mge.3.d:0 "This morning, Gustav Krupp, former leader of the Friedrich Krupp AG, has been found dead in his room. The precise details are withheld by the French military police. However, resistance cells have been able to spread the message he left behind. \n\n'I, Gustav Krupp, have been found guilty of treason, treason against an enemy of everything western civilization stands for. While I've never been completely innocent due to my ties with the German war industry, I should also have never been treated by the enemy in such brutal ways, comparable to tribal imprisonment. Justice has seemingly been lost by the French, as I will not follow any of their orders.' \n\nThe message of the note has become a widespread rumour and many celebrate Krupp's defiance against French authority."
mge.3.a:0 "May God have mercy on us all"
mge.4.t:0 "The Von Papen Trial"
mge.4.d:0 "As another high ranking prisoner of war, Franz von Papen has been brought to the military tribune based in Dijon as to hear his sentence as one of the many French enemies of the state. The noble Von Papen quietly listened to the tirade of the French minister of justice against his personality and loyalty to the Kaiser, as several cameras were pointed towards him. The lack of reaction infuriated the minister even more and Von Papen was beaten by military guards right then and there. The beaten and bloody Von Papen was then forced upon his chair once more, listening to another hour of ballistic French, before fainting. The tribune directly sentenced him to a political prisoners camp, of which the location is unknown."
mge.4.a:0 "A disturbing event..."
mge.5.t:0 "The body of Von Papen found"
mge.5.d:0 "Since the disturbing trial of Von Papen, during which he was beaten by his guards after giving no reaction to the French minister of justice, many speculated which labour camp he was moved to, as the location was held as a state secret. However, today we've hit a prisoners camp in Southern France. The people in the camp were hundreds of Germans coupled with several Belgian, Dutch and Italian citizens, all former political opposition to the French government. After freeing these people, our soldiers found the body of Franz von Papen, carelessly thrown inside a mass grave with several others. His body has been restored from the camp and is planned to be send to his family in Germany after the war has ended."
mge.5.a:0 "Atleast they'll get some closure..."
mge.6.t:0 "The Drexler Trial"
mge.6.d:0 "In a surprising twist of events, Anton Drexler, former leader of the NKDP and leader of the Nuremberg government, has been arrested by local French soldiers and driven to Dijon as to be trialed for his deeds. The French government, in a twist of irony, accused Anton Drexler of betraying his German race by capitulating to France, leaving the French without a proper war and without a good reason to wipe the German state off the map. In several official documents, French diplomats refered to Drexler as a possible threat and even the anti-christ himself, believing him to have gone insane with power. His treachery was enough for the military tribune to keep him in prison for his entire, miserable life."
mge.6.a:0 "Sure was a twist, wasn't it, Herr Drexler?"
