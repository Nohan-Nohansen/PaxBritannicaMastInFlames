  ##########################
PB_ROM_big_latin_sister:0 "The Big Latin Sister"
PB_ROM_big_latin_sister_desc:0 "Since our independence from the Ottoman Empire and the formation of the personal union between the kingdoms of Wallachia and Moldova, Romania’s elite and peasants have been surprisingly francophile, following the French trends of limited democracy and enlightenment ideals that came from the French enlightenment. This strong Francophile feeling is often translated as “big and little latin sisters”, describing the cultural bond between France and Romania rooted in the legacy of the Great Roman Empire that once ruled Dacia. This idealism has helped Romania into the Great War and has founded the basis of most of the Romanian far-right since Doriot’s government."
PB_ROM_regency:0 "Regency of Michael I"
PB_ROM_regency_desc:0 "Since the death of Ferdinand I, Michael I, his grandson, became the legitimate ruler of Romania. There was only one slight problem: Michael I was born in 1921 and was around the age of 6. This meant that Michael I could have never ruled Romania as an enlightened despot until 1939, forcing Romania into a regency council. The regency consists of three men: Prince Nicholas, second son of Ferdinand I, Miron Cristea, patriarch of the Romanian orthodox church, and Gheorge Buzdugan, head of the supreme court in Bucharest. The regency has now lasted 6 years and many in Romania are clearly yearning for a new king that will rule Romania."
PB_ROM_peasantry:0 "A Romanian life is a Peasants life"
PB_ROM_peasantry_desc:0 "While constant government efforts were made to modernize and industrialize Romania, almost 80% of its population keeps consisting of peasantry and a huge chunk of the economy remains dependant on the agricultural sector. While this has helped Romania in some forms and protected it during the economic crashes across Eastern Europe in the wake of the Great War, it continues to limit Romania’s economic capabilities and will not be able to support the needs of a modern, mechanized army that can keep Romania independent."
PB_ROM_legacy_of_carols_coup:0 "Legacy of Carol's Coup"
PB_ROM_legacy_of_carols_coup_desc:0 "Carol II's try at power in 1929 during the failed Romanian coup d’etat would set the present political landscape for Romania, one of a shared fear among party leadership for another attempt of removing the governing party of Romania as to replace it in favor of the authoritarian, nationalist and corrupt Carol II. This shared anti-Carol sentiment among all parties has created a  front against Carol, leading to party purges against traitors to Michael and his regent. Romania will remain gripped by this constant fear of instability till the death of Carol II."
PB_ROM_far_right:0 "Sneaking Power of the Legionaries"
PB_ROM_far_right_desc:0 "Since the Romanian loss of the Great War, radical ideas have been spread from the urban centre of Bucharest to the agrarian corners of the Romanian nation. The most popular ideas have been the once that are followed by the Iron Guard or Legionary Movement, a group of neo-imperialist radicals led by Corneliu Codreanu believing in the inherint values of being Romanian, agriculture and the orthodox monarchy. Their ideas have been on the rise ever since their split from the LANC and many fear the victory of the party in the upcoming 1933 election, as many men have become a loyal member to the Romanian death fetishists."

ROM_soften_semetic_laws_desc:0 "While Goga and his cabinet do not care for the daily struggles of the children of Israel, the pogroms of the legionary remnants have become extremely violent under the rule of Horia Sima and his band of misfits. Their anarchy has not only disrupted some of our greatest economic assets, but pose a threat to every Romanian citizen in Bucharest and the region surrounding the city. Thus, Goga has to crackdown."
ROM_rebrand_the_party:0 "National Renaissance Front"

ROM_exile_the_legionary_hardline_desc:0 "The Legionaries are not unlike the Jacobins for Goga: Both are radical extremists threatening the balance of Romanian society by glorifying morally disgusting ideals, such as violence and death worship. While Goga's nationalism is said to know no bounds, in reality, even Octavian Goga does not go as far as his legionary allies. Thus, to keep Romania safe, Goga will surpress the new hardline."
ROM_align_with_the_monarchy_desc:0 "The royalists are a great ally in the eyes of Goga: their ideals of conservative traditionalism and status quo perfectly fits with Goga's traditionalist and reactionary nationalism. They also enjoy a great amount of popularity among the population and could help Goga's reorganization of the party."

romania.1.t:0 "PSIR merges with SPR"
romania.1.d:0 "Due to the recent popularity of the Romanian far-right and the instability of our current cabinet, many socialist parties are trying to form an united opposition against the Romanian far-right. A clear example of this unification is the recent merge of the PSIR (Partidul Socialist Independent din România) with the Socialist Party of Romania under C. Popovici. The Socialist Party was once a splinter group of the social democrats, abandoning them as they were not radical enough in the eyes of Popovici's followers. The two parties share these radical ideas about republicanism and revolution and have thus merged into the United Socialist Party."
romania.1.a:0 "They will most likely not achieve anything..."
romania.2.t:0 "Bombing attack in Bucharest"
romania.2.d:0 "Shocking news dominated the newspapers of Romania today, as a bombing attack shakes the capital. The one responsible for the attack was quickly arrested by the police, claiming that the attack was planned by him and his comrades of the USP. While evidence is currently lacking to tie the attack with the radical USP, many Romanians have already turned their back on the new party after the attack. The Iron Guard has, as always, reaped the benefit, as the attack nicely fits in their ideology of violent socialism."
romania.2.a:0 "What a mess..."
romania.3.t:0 "1933 General Elections"
romania.3.d:0 "Thousands of civilians have gathered around the voting booths today, as the end of the electoral campaign has come to Romania. The vote went relatively well, with a few isolated incidents with the iron guard and the jacobin dissidents. Eventually, the votes were counted and the victor was announced: Corneliu's Iron Guard had won a majority of the votes, winning with a 6% margin against the liberal party and with a 11% margin against the less extreme national agrarian party of Goga. This will be the beginning of the iron guard government in the Romanian kingdom."
romania.3.a:0 "A troubling development"
romania.4.t:0 "Codreanu appointed as prime minister"
romania.4.d:0 "After the recent elections and the victory of Codreanu Corneliu's Iron Guard Party, king Michael and his regents, after long debate between the three regents about the danger of Codreanu for Romania, appointed the legionary leader as the next Romanian prime minister. In his speech, Codreanu assured the regents of the stability of Romania and promised the people a return to the past of Romanian hegemony. His speech was met with a silent applause from the elite present at his inauguration and with not a kick from any of the three regents next to him."
romania.4.a:0 "Let's hope he keeps his promise"
