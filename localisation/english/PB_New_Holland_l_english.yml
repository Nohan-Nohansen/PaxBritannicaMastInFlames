  POLITICS_Abraham_Johannes_Muste_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§!08/01/1885\n\nA clergyman by nature, political philosopher by trade has granted §YMr Muste§! all the tools necessary to efficiently run New-Holland as a beacon of business and democracy. Born in Zierikzee, Zeeland, he embraced the urban lifestyle much like his fellow siblings had, taking odd jobs here and there before landing a great deal with a dutch merchant company. Overseeing market values in Asia and the Pacific made him well accustomed to the climates and people who lived there. Eventually being chosen as the economic minister for the then young New-Holland colony a few years later.\n\nAs time continued the popularity of Muste only increased and he soon took up position of PM, now being in his second year of his four year limit. While foreign markets continue to plummet New-Holland has remained relatively stable, even seeing minor growth in some areas such as mining and shipping. Though not all is perfect for the relatively independent Dutch dominion. Nations under British, French, and German influence vie for dominance over the Oceanic region and war seems to be a likely outcome as the days pass by. "

  PB_NBT_Economy_desc:0 "The New Holland economy has seen an explosion of success. The large deposit of rare minerals on mainland Oceania has greatly attributed to this fact, that as well as the competency of the ruling government that has ensured the small colony stays relevant in Asian-Pacific affairs. Everyday a new factory is opened up and hundreds are employed in sustainable, well paying jobs; continously feeding the colonies thirst for new settlers and skilled labour."

  PB_NBT_Stable_Nation:0 "Stable Nation"
  PB_NBT_Stable_Nation_desc:0 "The Constitution that enshrines the New Holland colony is one of fairness, equality, and opportunity. The continued successes of previous and current governments have maintained a prestigious political atmosphere that has bled into the New-Hollander consciousness, citizens remain confident in bureaucratic workings leading to great stability and freedoms rarely seen in the modern world.
