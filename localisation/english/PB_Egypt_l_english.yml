  egypt.1.t:0 "Constitutionalist Protests"
  egypt.1.d:0 "The sudden economic meltdown in Britain has had ripple effects across the entire Imperial sphere. This has been acutely felt in Egypt, where the sudden dropoff in demand for exports has lead to the near collapse of the agricultural economy. Though the nascent industrialization in the cities has shielded them somewhat from the export market collapse, the countryside is feeling the crunch. The rural economy was largely dependent on inter-imperial exports, and without demand, crops are simply rotting in the fields or in markets.\n\nNaturally, the people demand the government respond to the Crisis. We've passed some token reforms to try and pacify the peasantry, but the main force of the protests has now shifted towards demands for a full constitution. Reformists accuse the King of decadent excess and are asking him to consent to a parliamentary constitutional convention to try and sate the unrest. Obviously this is a ridiculous idea. The situation is entirely under control."
  egypt.1.a:0 "Order the Army to crack down on the protest"

  egypt.2.t:0 "The Royal Army turns on the Government"
  egypt.2.d:0 "Rather than turning their guns on the protests, the Royal Army has instead chosen to turn them against the Royalist government. Caught off guard by the sudden turn of events, those loyal to the monarchy were quickly disarmed or taken down by the Constitutionalist leadership. Now at the gunpoint of the Kingdom's own military, Faud is forced to either accept a parliamentary constitution or potentially be forced to abdicate entirely."
  egypt.2.a:0 "The Army forces the King to accept a Constitution"
  egypt.2.b:0 "Down with the Monarchy! Long Live the Republic!"
