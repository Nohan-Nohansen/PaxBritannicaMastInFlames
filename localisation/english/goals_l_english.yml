 AUS_state_of_nation_desc:0 "It has been decades since the Great War decimated our nation, and even today there are scars that have yet to heal.

 AUS_1937_vienna_conference_desc:0 "The Vienna Conference has been an annual staple of the party since it seized control years ago. Members of the Fatherland Front from around the nation come together in Vienna to discuss the direction of the country. This year’s conference has proven unique, as various blocks within the party have begun to seek power."

 AUS_ultranationalist_monarchy_desc:0 "The Habsburgs have ruled Austria for centuries, and they shall rule it once more. While the true aire to the throne, Ferdinand, lies in exile in France, another member of the family has come forward to propose his rule.

 AUS_peoples_army_desc:0 "The hatred for the Hungarians is not unfounded, but it is getting in the way of our conscription efforts.

 AUS_purge_old_guard:0 "Purge the Old Guard"
 AUS_purge_old_guard_desc:0 "The traditionalists have not been thrilled with our new reforms, to say the least. As their dissent grows, our ability to create a true Strasserist state falters. None can stand in the way of the revolution. They must be dealt with. Harshly."

 AUS_balkans_dominance_desc:0 "Austria has, historically, dominated the Balkan region. Previously, this was either through royalty, or as a bulwark against Islamic Turkish expansionism. Now, we must dominate the Balkans through military force. Though Romania is under our control, there are many smaller Southern states that must be subjugated before we can truly turn out attentions outwards."
 AUS_macedonia_for_alliance:0 "The Macedonian Exchange"

 AUS_the_old_alliance:0 "Renew the Turko-German Alliance"
 AUS_the_old_alliance_desc:0 "Our alliance with the former Ottoman Empire was one of convenience during the last war. Both our empires were dismembered by the Triple Entente after the conflict, giving rise to similar ultranationalist ideals. Though the Turks may dream of a new caliphate, perhaps we could reach an agreement of mutual defense, given our shared enemies."
 AUS_ties_to_bulgaria:0 "Renew Ties with the Bulgars"
 AUS_ties_to_bulgaria_desc:0 "Though Bulgaria is inhabited by Slavic peoples, it previously aligned with the Central Powers. Though some of the most hardline ideologues of the party might protest, an alliance with the Bulgars could give us further access to the Black Sea and beyond, even more than the ports used in the Romanian Colony. "
 AUS_bulgaria_partition_treaty:0 "Bulgarian Partition Treay"
 AUS_bulgaria_partition_treaty_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire once stretched far into the Balkans, and our recent alliance has facilitated a resurgence in Turkish expansionism.

 AUS_threaten_serbia:0 "Ultimatum to Serbia"
 AUS_threaten_serbia_desc:0 "The Serbs have been a thorn in our side since time immemorial. Their constant border sparks, rebellions and revolutions nearly toppled the old Empire. Now, we have the chance to end the Serbian menace, once and for all."
 AUS_threaten_bosnia:0 "Threaten Bosnia"
 AUS_threaten_bosnia_desc:0 "Continuing on our expansion to subjugate the Balkan states, we now find Bosnia. Though we’ve had little issues with the Bosnian peoples, it seems that bringing them into the fold would be for the best. If we are to see a truly German reich, then we cannot allow a small minority state on our border."
 AUS_germanize_serbia:0 "Serbian Germanization Programme"
 AUS_germanize_serbia_desc:0 "With the Serbian government in exile and their lands under our control, plans have been drafted to expand our Germanization programmes to the region. The plan calls for ethnic Serbs to be moved to resettlement facilities while their land is appropriated for German settlers. Our advisors assure us that these facilities are merely a temporary measure, and following the conclusion of the programme, the Serbs will be moved to secure reservations, in a similar vein to those used in the Americas by the French and Mexicans."
 AUS_germanize_bosnia:0 "Bosnian Germanization Programme"
 AUS_germanize_bosnia_desc:0 "Bosnia has fallen, and with it, their government has fled. As with the rest of the nation, Germanization programmes will be established to bring the region to the standards of the homeland. Bosnians and other ethnic groups will be moved to resettlement facilities, clearing the way for German settlement. Our advisors anticipate some resistance, but nothing that we can’t handle."
 AUS_germanization_programs:0 "National Germanization Programme"
 AUS_germanization_programs_desc:0 "With the most powerful Balkan states under our control, we can now institute more widespread Germanization policies. In the homeland, these policies helped rid us of the threat of Hungarian resistance and Bolshevik thought. Instituting these policies throughout the new empire will make it easier to enforce conscription among the populace, particular in regions with a Germanic minority."
 AUS_threaten_albania:0 "Threaten Albania"
 AUS_threaten_albania_desc:0 "Albania is a rump state. Though we’ve previously had few aims on them, expanding our control over ports in the Mediterranean could prove useful if we intend to assist the Turks in the Middle East. "
 AUS_threaten_croatia:0 "Threaten Croatia"
 AUS_threaten_croatia_Desc:0 "The Croatian state has, for some time, been a thorn in our side. Minor border clashes have occurred since the end of the Great War, fueled primarily by the small Croat minority on our shared border. Eliminating them will remove yet another unruly Balkan state, and allow further expansion of our Mediterranean holdings."

 AUS_proclaim_greater_austria_focus_tt:0 "§GThe Greater Austrian Reich is formally declared to the world!§!\n"
 AUS_proclaim_greater_austria_desc:0 "With the Balkans fully pacified and dominated by German interests, we can now officially proclaim the Greater Austrian Reich to the world. This victory of the party over the region will now allow us to look further outwards, into the heart of central Europe and beyond."
 AUS_romanian_integration:0 "The Romanian Integration Programme"
 AUS_romanian_integration_desc:0 "The eventual integration of the Romanian Occupied Territory has been a key goal since the monarchy was deposed years ago. The programme has been on the table for some time, and we would do well to finally begin instituting the policies that were planned for it."
 AUS_purge_iron_guard:0 "Purge the Iron Guard"
 AUS_purge_iron_guard_desc:0 "The Iron Guard has been the muscle for the occupation force since it was established. However, their previously hyper-nationalistic politics have raised some concerns within the government. We should carefully remove their leaders from government positions and replace them with Austrian authorities."
 AUS_integrate_iron_guard:0 "Integrate the Iron Guard"
 AUS_integrate_iron_guard_desc:0 "The Iron Guard has proven their loyalty to the regime time and again. We should put forward a plan to fully integrate them into the occupation forces, to serve as an example to those Romanians who might be skeptical of our Germanization programme."
 AUS_ban_orthodoxy:0 "Ban Orthodox Practices"
 AUS_ban_orthodoxy_desc:0 "The dominant religion of Romania was previously Eastern Orthodoxy, a faith which is common among most Slavic nations. If we are to fully Germanize the populace, the Eastern Orthodox church must be smashed and their power-base eliminated. "

 AUS_economic_recovery_desc:0 "The economic crash has wounded us, but given the nature of our government, we can initiate a widespread national recovery programme without the need for public support."
 AUS_seize_hungarian_assets:0 "Seize Hungarian Business Assets"
 AUS_seize_hungarian_assets_desc:0 "Despite various anti-Hungarian laws, their people still own considerable wealth. A key part of our national recovery scheme is to seize business assets from wealthy Hungarians, and use them to fund our recovery efforts. Not only that, but actions against the Hungarian populace will help crush any seditious individuals that might still lurk among them."
 AUS_exploit_romanian_oil:0 "Exploit Romanian Oil Wealth"
 AUS_exploit_romanian_oil_desc:0 "Romania has considerable oil deposits, most of which are already maintained by the Austrian colonial government. However, there are still some privately owned deposits that could be nationalized for the recovery effort. We should acquire these deposits, by force if necessary, and exploit them to support the Reich."
 AUS_economics_of_conflict:0 "The Economics of Conflict"
 AUS_economics_of_conflict_desc:0 "Conflict is, at least economically speaking, a boon. We can organize our entire economic structure around war and conquest, giving us a leading edge over the economies of Britain and France. "
 AUS_skoda_arms:0 "Škoda Arms Deal"
 AUS_skoda_arms_desc:0 "Skoda is one of the leading Czech arms companies, and previously supplied both Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Great War. We should approach them to see if we can, once again, cut a deal for further arms dealings."
 AUS_fortress_austria:0 "Fortress Austria"
 AUS_fortress_austria_desc:0 "Austria lies in one of the most mountainous regions of Europe, and is thus easily defended. However, with the advent of new technologies, more natural defenses may not do the trick like they did before. We should institute programs to expand our national defenses, particularly on the border with the Italian peninsula."
 AUS_corporatist_economics:0 "Corporatist Economics"
 AUS_corporatist_economics_desc:0 "Corporations are the cornerstone of the economy. Keeping them happy and on our side will be a key part of maintaining industrial capacity during conflict. We should orient our economy towards corporate conglomerates, and work to undermine and destroy any socialist labour or union groups that remain active in the Reich."
 AUS_faith_and_fatherland:0 "Faith and Fatherland"
 AUS_faith_and_fatherland_desc:0 "Austria is a catholic nation, and shall remain so forevermore. We should approach church leadership to try and integrate party politics with sermons and religious ideals. A union between the Front and the Church would further consolidate power and allow us more avenues to exert control over the population."
 AUS_new_life_programme:0 "The New Life Programme"
 AUS_new_life_programme_desc:0 "Leisure and a high quality of life is key to keeping our population happy and supportive. Some advisors have proposed the so-called “New Life” programme, organized to provide leisure and tourism activities for our citizens. Such a programme would be widely supported by Austrian citizens, who would have much to gain, and would allow us to further control the influx of ideas."
 AUS_socialist_crackdown:0 "Crush Socialist Thought"
 AUS_socialist_crackdown_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, there is still a vocal socialist minority within Austria. It has been proposed that we institute a nationwide crackdown on those that still remain. More specifically, we can use this to not only eliminate Austrian socialists, but also those Hungarians that still resist Austrian dominance."
 AUS_ban_restorationists:0 "Ban Restorationist Ideas"
 AUS_ban_restorationists_desc:0 "Ever since the King of Romania was deposed, there have been underground movements to bring him back to power. Eliminating the restorationists should be a key part of the Romanian Integration Programme. A national crackdown should be instituted, and any confirmed Restorationists eliminated. "
 AUS_austrian_settlement:0 "Austrian Settlement Initiative"
 AUS_austrian_settlement_desc:0 "If the region of Romania is to be properly Germanized, then we must ensure that Germans are the majority ethnic group. This can be achieved by simply shifting the Romanian population to resettlement facilities, where they can be processed to be moved to larger reservations in the countryside. This would open up considerable living space for Germanic settlement."
 AUS_ban_romanian_language:0 "Ban the Romanian Language"
 AUS_ban_romanian_language_desc:0 "The very idea of the Romanian people must be utterly eliminated, and thus we should institute a ban on the use of the Romanian language. Children in the territory will be taught to speak proper German, and will be raised in the German way. We must wipe the very concept of the Romanian nation from existence."
 AUS_forced_labour_romania:0 "Forced Labour in Romania"
 AUS_forced_labour_romania_desc:0 "While we have moved a large number of Romanians to reservations, where they can live far away from German settlers, we are not using them to their full potential. A forced labour programme would provide the resettled Romanians with a sense of pride and accomplishment in serving the greater Reich."
 AUS_final_integration:0 "Final Integration"
 AUS_final_integration_desc:0 "With Romania almost entirely integrated, we can now officially annex the region as a full part of the Austrian reich. Romania is no more, and now the area becomes simply an eastern region of our new Empire."
 AUS_looking_outwards:0 "The Reich on the World Stage"
 AUS_looking_outwards_desc:0 "If Austria is to once more stand among the great powers of Europe, she must look beyond just her immediate neighbors. We must go on the diplomatic and military offensive to secure alliances, lest they become yet more swords in the hands of perfidious Albion."
 AUS_polish_question:0 "The Polish Question"
 AUS_polish_question_desc:0 "Poland is a new country, relatively speaking. Borne from the humiliating post-war treaties that brought ruin to the Central Powers, it stands between us and our Germanic brothers in Prussia. How we approach the Polish is key; while a military strike might be the most immediately advantageous, approaching the Poles more pragmatically might save material and resources, albeit at the cost of angering the Prussians."
 AUS_ally_poland:0 "An Open Hand"
 AUS_ally_poland_tooltip:0 "§GWe must have pursued a diplomatic policy towards Poland§!\n"
 AUS_ally_poland_desc:0 "Though our old empire partitioned Poland with Germany and Russia, we cannot let old wounds get in the way of progress. Both our nations have much to gain, though supporting the Polish Republic could anger the Prussian government, who still hold claims on the Danzig strip."
 AUS_annex_poland:0 "A Closed Fist"
 AUS_annex_poland_tooltip:0 "§GWe must have pursued an expansionistic policy towards Poland or our offer of alliance was refused§!\n"
 AUS_annex_poland_desc:0 "Poland is a worthless rump state, and is of little use to us. We cannot allow the fear of the Polish army to stop us from marching straight to the Baltic. It will not engender us much love from the international community, but we believe it unlikely that the British or the French will intervene."
 AUS_backstab_prussia:0 "Stab the Prussians in the Back"
 AUS_backstab_prussia_desc:0 "The future of the German peoples is not in Berlin, but in Vienna. The German Empire fell, as did the Weimar Republic, showing the failure of the governments in Berlin. It is now up to us to unite the German peoples in a far greater union than even Bismarck could have imagined."
 AUS_danzig_for_alliance:0 "Danzig for Alliance"
 AUS_danzig_for_alliance_desc:0 "Ever since Danzig was given to the Poles, German nationalists have claimed it theirs. With Poland defeated, we are in a unique position with our Prussian comrades. We should offer an exchange; we will turn Danzig to the Prussians, and they will join our alliance."
 AUS_pan_germanism:0 "The Pan German Dream"
 AUS_pan_germanism_desc:0 "Since the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, philosophers have dreamed of a united Pan-Germanic state. Now, we stand in a position to make those dreams a reality. All Germans must be united under the cause of the Reich, and we will create a far grander state than even the founders of the Front could have envisioned."
 AUS_german_reunification:0 "Push for German Reunification"
 AUS_german_reunification_desc:0 "The former Weimar Republic was shattered by political infighting and civil war, leaving a patchwork of claimed successors. With Prussia by our side, we should push for the reunification of Germany under their banner. This will draw ire from the other states, but our burgeoning empire won’t thrive without a little nerve."
 AUS_sudetenland:0 "Demand the Sudetenland"
 AUS_sudetenland_desc:0 "The Sudetenland, held by the Czechs, contains a small but vocal German minority. With Pan-German fervor spreading throughout Central Europe, fringe nationalist groups have approached us pushing to be united with their brothers and sisters. If the Czechs are unwilling to release the region, we can back our claims with force."
 AUS_rhineland_or_war:0 "Rhineland or War"
 AUS_rhineland_or_war_desc:0 "The French have, since the first sparks of the Weimar Civil War, occupied the Rhineland under an unlawful puppet regime. We cannot stand for this. If all German peoples are to be unified, we must seize back the Rhineland from the hands of the French. "

 AUS_backstab_the_polish:0 "Stab the Polish in the Back"
 AUS_backstab_the_polish_desc:0 "The Polish have served their use, and now can be dealt with properly. A covert military operation to sabotage their capital and military, followed by a full military strike, should overturn their government and allow for full annexation."

 AUS_ally_japan:0 "The Rising Sun"
 AUS_ally_japan_desc:0 "Japan allied against us in the last war, of that there is no doubt. However, the situation has greatly changed in Asia, and we are in a unique position to open relations with the fledgeling Empire. Perhaps the land of the Rising Sun could help split the British and French navies between the Pacific and Atlantic?"
 AUS_generalplan_ost:0 "Prepare Generalplan Ost"
 AUS_generalplan_ost_desc:0 "Russia has been a broken rump state since the Bolshevik Revolution was defeated. Though their nation is shattered, they still hold on to an immense amount of resources. Acquiring arable land in the Russian west would not just provide us with vast amounts of food, but also with significantly more resources. "
 AUS_renew_mexican_ties:0 "Renew Ties to Mexico"
 AUS_renew_mexican_ties_desc:0 "The Mexican Empire, though on the verge of collapse, could prove a valuable ally to open a front in North America. Striking at the British possessions in the region could force them off the continent entirely, if we can support our Mexican comrades."
 AUS_generalplan_ost_winter_climate_training:0 "Winter Climate Training Programmes"
 AUS_generalplan_ost_winter_climate_training_desc:0 "The harsh climate of Russia is something that our army will have to contend with, if we intend on conquest. We should begin training our armed forces in winter acclimatization, to allow them to better survive in the Russian East."
 AUS_generalplan_ost_supply_regiments:0 "Improved Logistics Regiments"
 AUS_generalplan_ost_supply_regiments_desc:0 "Invasions of Russia have, traditionally, suffered supply problems. If we intend on success, we must circumvent these issues. We should train specific divisions for handling our supply convoys, which should reduce our overall supply consumption."

 AUS_generalplan_ost_enemy_mine:0 "The Enemy of our Enemy"
 AUS_generalplan_ost_enemy_mine_desc:0 "Grand Caucasia, a tinpot ultranationalist dictatorship to the South, has little love for the Russians. We should propose a temporary alliance with them, as they could assist us in splitting the Russian forces and reduce our expenditure of forces."
 AUS_eliminate_stalin:0 "Eliminate Grand Caucasia"
 AUS_eliminate_stalin_desc:0 "The dictator of Grand Caucasia, Ioseb Jughashvili, is a brutal man. Not just that, but given his sheltering of communists, we cannot trust him. Jughashvili must be eliminated and replaced, allowing us absolute control of the region. "
 AUS_vienna_institute:0 "Establish the Vienna Institute"
 AUS_vienna_institute_desc:0 "Collaboration on scientific research is the way of the future. The British have their London Institute, and the French have their Paris Institute.

 AUS_german_tank_designs:0 "Examine German Tank Designs"
 AUS_german_tank_designs_desc:0 "German tank designs have improved greatly since the end of the Great War, even if production has been hampered by the Weimar conflict. We should attempt to acquire German tanks to reverse engineer them for our own purposes."
 AUS_nationalize_steyr:0 "Nationalize Steyr Manufacturing"
 AUS_nationalize_steyr_desc:0 "Steyr is a major Austrian arms manufacturer, and has been largely cooperative with the regime. Nonetheless, acquiring direct control over their manufacturing facilities would make it far easier to develop and produce rifle designs."
