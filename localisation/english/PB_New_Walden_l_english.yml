PB_NWA_Home_Of_Mother_Anarchy_desc:0 "Spurred on by the teachings of American transcendentalist Henry David Thorea, New Walden is a state without a state. In laymen terms it houses no government of any kind save for the few community councils littered throughout the nation’s landscape. New Walden has no military, no economy, it has nothing. New Walden is a green anarchistic paradise, one that comes with all the positives and negatives such a sociopolitical theory brings."
