PB_NZL_king_movement:0 "The Kingitanga"
PB_NZL_king_movement_desc:0 "The Kingitanga (Maori King Movement) is one of the most successful challenges against British Imperialism in the last 100 years. Awarding the country not with the status of ‘Possession’ but of ‘Dominion’. The line of Maori kings now represents hope and stability for the increasingly larger Maori Population of Aotearoa. Many Pakeha (White Men) have also come to respect, and admire the Kingitanga for its actions and its statesman like conduct."
PB_NZL_spectre_of_the_royal_navy:0 "The Spectre of the Royal Navy"
PB_NZL_spectre_of_the_royal_navy_desc:0 "Aotearoan have long memories, particularly of Kororāreka where a Royal Navy Gunboat was able to halt a Maori attack in its tracks, and threw the warriors back like beaten dogs. In 1908 a challenge by the Aotearoan Parliament against the British was answered by the sudden arrival of HMS Dreadnought in Tāmaki (Auckland) Harbour. The primary barrier to an independent or powerful Aotearoa is the ever hanging Sword of Damocles that the Royal Navy represents."
PB_NZL_language_question:0 "Two Language Question"
PB_NZL_language_question_desc:0 "Aotearoa has no official language, subsequent governments having chosen to kick the problem down the line, rather than alienate either half of the Dominion’s population. A man born in New Zealand may walk down a street, and be completely unable to make conversation on one block, but fluent on the next. The issues have spilled over into the Armed forces, with some drill instructors unable to converse with recruits."
