  PB_BRU_Unofficial_Protectorate:0 "The Unofficial Protectorate"
  PB_BRU_Unofficial_Protectorate_desc:0 "The Nation of Brunei is, at least on paper, independent. Reality can be rather disappointing, however. Brunei's recent development and industrialization comes off the back of Anglo and Anglo-American oil interests, who have invested extensively throughout the country. Corruption runs rampant as the young Sultan finds himself increasingly sidelined by his regents, who constantly line their pockets with British funds. Unless the situation is brought under control, Brunei may find herself more than just an unofficial client state of perfidious albion."
  PB_BRU_Resistance_to_Industrialization:0 "The Future, Whether You Want it or Not"
  PB_BRU_Resistance_to_Industrialization_desc:0 "The world is changing at a rapid pace, and Brunei's immense oil wealth has brought industry and development. The same changes that have made the country's coffers grow fat are the same changes that now drive people to the streets to demand rights and wages. Those same people secretly plot the end of our government, undoubtedly, spreading the ideological contagion of constitutionalism or worse, the Japanese lie of Pan-Asian liberation. Brunei must rectify these contradictions, or risk being consumed by them."

  PB_SNG_Straits_Settlements:0 "The Straits Settlements"
  PB_SNG_Straits_Settlements_desc:0 "Singapore is the central pillar of the Straits Settlements, a series of individual settlements across Malaysia. These settlements are largely Anglified, and represent the main thrust of Britain's efforts to civilize the far east. The settlements themselves are an intricate web of varying colonial authorities and plantations, just as much of a detriment as they are a benefit, but they represent a dream of a god-fearing, English speaking and most importantly, culturally European Malayasia."
  PB_SNG_Japanese_Threat:0 "Shadow of the Red Shogun"
  PB_SNG_Japanese_Threat_desc:0 "Since the Japanese Revolution, Asia has lived under the looming shadow of the Japanese menace. To the North, where red banners fly, Tokyo speaks of self-determination and Asian liberation, words that evoke nothing short of horror in the minds of British administrators.\n\nJapanese propaganda has helped prop up left wing Malaysian sentiment, and it must be contained lest it be allowed to truly take root."

  PB_MNC_Heavily_Armed_Neutrality:0 "Heavily Armed Neutrality"
  PB_MNC_Heavily_Armed_Neutrality_desc:0 "The outbreak of the December Putsch War in Italy has left Monaco in an unfortunate position. With much of their military protection afforded by Italy and France unwilling to intervene on their behalf, the country has had to scrape together a small militia force to protect itself. Monaco's immense wealth has allowed it to mass purchase armaments and materials to build up a defensive perimeter around the country. While the D'Annunzio hasn't made any moves against the Principality, there's no assurance that it won't."

  PB_MNC_Monte_Carlo:0 "Europe's Gambling Den"
  PB_MNC_Monte_Carlo_desc:0 "Monaco is one of the richest countries in Europe, despite being one of the smallest on the continent. The country is the gambling den and bank for much of the European elite, even eclipsing Switzerland in some regards. The crown jewel of this is the Casino and Hotel Monte Carlo, which plays host to everyone from royalty to film stars and athletes."

  PB_MNC_Syncretic_Society:0 "Mediterranean Syncretism"
  PB_MNC_Syncretic_Society_desc:0 "Following a Succession Crisis in 1911, the crown of the Principality passed to Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach. Though there were protests against the notion of a German Prince, the diplomatic pressure from Frankfurt convinced the government otherwise, and Wilhelm was crowned as Prince William I of Monaco. Following his death in 1928, the crown passed to his daughter Elisabeth, who continues to rule as Princess.\n\nThis curious turn of events created a unique situation for Monaco, which began to experience an influx of German tourism and business. This so-called Germanization was both welcomed and decried by the country's elite, who felt their position was being eroded. Ultimately, the outcome of this was a syncretized society, influenced by elements of Italian, French and German culture."

  PB_VAT_Treaty_of_1861:0 "The Naples-Rome Treaty of 1861"
  PB_VAT_Treaty_of_1861_desc:0 "The Naples-Rome Treaty of 1861 marked the final conclusion of the Italian Unification Wars. Under the terms of the treaty, the Papal States dropped their claims on Central Italy and were reduced to control of Vatican City. The treaty additionally marked the end of the Papacy as any form of military power, and the Holy See relinquished their right to launch offensive wars. The Vatican is wholly dependent on the Italian Kingdom for protection as part of this charter, for better or for worse."
  
  PB_VAT_National_Doubt:0 "A Crisis of Faith"
  PB_VAT_National_Doubt_desc:0 "In the Book of Exodus, Moses was horrified to discover the Israelites had begun to worship a false god, a golden calf. From the halls of the Vatican, the Catholic Church cannot help but feel they are watching the same thing happen again. The world changes day by day, and day by day mankind rejects the love of his god in favor of the cold certainty of steel. Spires of megacities scrape the heavens, modern towers of Babel upon which this new church of rust and blood is founded. All of this raises the question, shall the Catholic Church embrace this dawning epoch of metal, or shall it be swept aside in the feverous march of progress?"

  PB_ADR_Legacy_of_Fatima:0 "Legacy of Fátima"
  PB_ADR_Legacy_of_Fatima_desc:0 "The catastrophe of the Fátima Revolution brought Spain and Portugal under the heel of fundamentalism, leaving Andorra and the Basque Republic alone against an army of fanatics. The most acute effect of the Revolutions was the mass exodus of Catholic moderates from Spain, with many fleeing to the North and Italy to seek protection from overzealous Spanish inquisitors.\n\nAndorra's population has exploded since the Revolutions, bolstering the economy yet at the same time bringing with it further political chaos."

  PB_ADR_Refugee_Crisis:0 "Refugee Crisis"
  PB_ADR_Refugee_Crisis_desc:0 "Though the situation has calmed in recent years, there remains an ever present surge of refugees fleeing Iberia for greener pastures. Andoraa, as a beacon of relative stability, is one of the prime targets for this surge, despite our increasing difficulty in keeping the situation under control."

  PB_ADR_British_Imposition:0 "The British Imposition"
  PB_ADR_British_Imposition_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Great War, Andorra, despite being neutral, found itself in a curious position. With London and Frankfurt hellbent on permanently crippling France, the issue of the co-princedom was raised. Though many argued against it, the British ultimately enforced an ultimatum on Andorra to abolish the French side of the Princedom. With British troops barely a stone's throw away in Northern Iberia, hardened by the years of the Iberian Campaign, Andorra opted to cave to British pressure. The French Principality was abolished, and Andorra was reorganized as a singular Bishopric.\n\nThe decision was deeply unpopular, and to this day there is animosity between the Bishopric and Britain, sometimes even bordering into a revanchist sentiment. Given Andorra's size and geopolitical position, however, survival is more important than pride."
