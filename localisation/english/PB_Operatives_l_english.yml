upgrade_anti_partisan_desc:0 "§LPropaganda is a powerful tool to ensure the loyalty of our own citizens, but creating compliance in enemy lands is much more complex. By training our operatives to infiltrate enemy resistance movements, we may begin being able to make effective arrests and end their disruptive activities. Surely then, foreign partisans will lose any hope of returning to their old regime.§!"
upgrade_commando_training:0 "Breaker Camp Training"
upgrade_commando_training_desc:1 "§LWhile our department usually handles the subtler aspects of war, often a small team of heavily armed soldiers are what's needed to complete our operations. By training all of our operatives the ways of Commando warfare, they will become more effective at sabotage operations, less likely to be detected by enemy counter-intelligence and more capable at capturing enemy cryptologic equipment.§!"
upgrade_crypto_strength_2:0 "Augmented Analysis Bureau"
upgrade_crypto_strength_2_desc:0 "§LIt's becoming apparent that our standard method of creating cyphers is insufficient to protect our communications from enemy eyes. Our finest minds have theorised a machine which can scramble the letters of the alphabet to generate new cyphers on as regular a basis as we desire. Deploying such technology would make our encryption methods a total enigma to our enemies.§!"

upgrade_interrogation_techniques:0 "Information Extraction Chamber"
upgrade_interrogation_techniques_desc:0 "§LOften it can be more effective to break an enemy agent's mind rather than their body. The use of physical force is unreliable and often results in false information; a truly skilled interrogator is capable of breaking the enemy's will without violence. But, if it comes to that, we have ways of making them talk...§!"
