 VIC_admiral_pacific:0 "The Admiral's Influence"
 VIC_admiral_pacific_desc:0 "Born in Frankfurt as Louis Battenberg, he could trace his lineage back to the Grand Duke of Hesse, while his mother hailed from British Empire royalty. The young lad was nurtured in an Anglo-German milieu steeped in liberal values, showing early promise in both leadership and eloquence. Amid the Great War's turmoil, Louis and his mother sought refuge in London, where he opted for the moniker Lewis, sensing the prevailing Francophobia in Britain. \n\nIn due course, after receiving a thorough British education at Cambridge, he embarked on a naval career. Leveraging his acumen and royal connections, he gained entry as an officer in the navy. His intelligence extended beyond military matters; he delved into the cultural tapestry of the regions he was stationed, absorbing the folk narratives of Okinawa and immersing himself in the unique amalgamation of East and West in the Pearl Delta. \n\nWith commendable progression, he ascended to the rank of vice admiral just as the Second Great War began to run its devastating course. Upon the tragic loss of his superior to a Russian bomb, he emerged as the natural choice to helm the Pacific Fleet. Yet, in the expansive and distant expanse of the Pacific, his influence on the war's trajectory remained limited. And when news trickled in that Frankfurt had fallen, a part of him broke; when news trickled in that London had fallen, another part of him broke; and when news trickled in that the Japanese had seized British islands like vultures feasting on a corpse, he found himself lacking even the fragments that remained. \n\nRegardless of the titles that may still accompany his name, irrespective of the tears he may have shed for his homeland, today's Lewis Battenberg is a new man, worlds apart from the gentleman who once commanded the Pacific Fleet nearly two decades ago. He now navigates the tempestuous seas of politics, a far cry from the oceans he once sailed. His orders now target campaign managers and captains of industry, instead of the comrades in arms he once counted as friends. His arsenal comprises sharp-edged words and divisive rhetoric, replacing the artillery shells that once fascinated him. \n\nDespite his enjoyment, or lack thereof, of his current position, he recognizes the imperative for a leader during these chaotic times —one capable of reinstating that time of peace, that Pax Britannica."
 VIC_tattered_flag_royal_navy:0 "The Tattered Flag of the Royal Navy"
 VIC_tattered_flag_royal_navy_desc:0 "“Whoever commands the sea, commands the trade; whosoever commands the trade of the world, commands the riches of the world, and consequently the world itself.” \n- Walter Raleigh \n\nWiser words have never been spoken; from the Greeks at Salamis to Romans at Actium, the seas have always been the lifeblood of empires. It should be a shock to no one then that after the Royal Navy lost control of the waves, the British Empire ceased to exist. As colonial garrisons across the world lost contact with London, the natives rose up and liberated themselves from the shackles of imperialism. As admirals across the oceans lost contact with London, rival powers snatched up the territory they wanted. Truly then, the demise of the Royal Navy marked the conclusion of the Pax Britannica. \n\nNow as the Royal Navy convalesces in the last bastion of the British Empire, Oceania, its ire and disdain has converged upon one enemy, Japan. Since the end of the Second Great War, the old commanders have been planning and plotting, proposing a variety of campaigns across the Pacific. These have ranged from the improbable notion of reclaiming Micronesia from the Japanese grip to the inconceivable prospect of a naval incursion into Tokyo Bay. Regardless of their likelihood, these war games have notably bolstered our capacity to contend with Japan on the high seas. And perhaps, in due course, when we finally regain mastery of the ocean, we can return to those good old days, that Pax Britannica."
 VIC_troubles:0 "The Troubles"
 VIC_troubles_desc:0 "Our relationship with Aotearoa is far from stable, to say the least. Ever since our union was established in the twilight of the Second Great War, Aotearoans have been pressing for greater autonomy. In fact, radical factions within the Aotearoan Republican Army have even gone so far as to advocate for complete independence. However, it's crucial to recognize that the Aotearoan Republican Army isn't the sole militant entity in the region. The Anglo Volunteer Force, comprised of far-right militiamen fervently defending 'English culture', has clashed with peaceful protestors across Aotearoa. This, inevitably, has triggered retaliatory strikes by the ARA. The level of violence has escalated to such an extent that we've had no choice but to deploy security forces and entire army battalions to Aotearoa's major cities. To further compound the issue, the British Remnants have taken a keen interest in the conflict. They've been leveraging their connections and vast resources to arm and train the AVF, redirecting funds originally intended for the navy. \n\nAs time has passed, the situation has only worsened. Bombings and shootings have tragically become a grim daily occurrence in most cities and towns. It's a situation that requires immediate and decisive action from the current administration, as the escalating turmoil has deeply unsettled the Oceanian populace, creating a pressing need for resolution. \n\n§RWe have received dire warning from insiders in both groups, the tempest of violence, once confined to Aotearoa's shores, threatens to surge forth and engulf far more than we can fathom.§!"
 VIC_admiral_pacific_legacy:0 "The Admiral's Legacy"
 VIC_admiral_pacific_legacy_desc:0 "When there is no captain to steer the ship, and no general to lead the army, who steps forward? The People’s Front of Aotearoa has undeniably dealt a blow to our organization. No one seems poised to rise to the occasion, no one can hope to fill the void left by the late admiral. Yet, in the face of this leadership vacuum, our strength endures. The admiral's wisdom has transformed us from a fringe group into a force that wields influence over the government, capable of open defience of the Holland Administration. And as our hold on the National Party tightens, an opportunity emerges with the approaching 1960 elections. Sadly, the admiral won't witness his vision come to fruition, leaving it to us to carry on his legacy. We can now glimpse the light at the end of the tunnel—the dream of returning home, avenging the lost mothers and fathers, and liberating the still-bound brothers and sisters. It's no longer just a dream; it’s tangible, it feels within reach. The only obstacle in our path is the Labor Party and their perfidious embrace of socialism, a betrayal of their homeland. We will not let them get in our way. \n\n§RWe have waited for long enough, we will act, and we will act soon, all or nothing, we will not stay in this shithole for any longer; your legacy, admiral, your dream will come to fruition either through peace or war.§!"
