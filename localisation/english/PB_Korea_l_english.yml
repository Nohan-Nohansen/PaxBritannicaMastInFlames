  korea.1.t:0 "Chaos in the Capital"
  korea.1.d:0 "With civil war raging in China, the fires of revolutionary fervor have spread to Korea. In the streets of Seoul, revolutionary leaders have begun a series of protests against the government demanding for civil liberties. The deeply unpopular absolutist government faces its' worst crisis since the invasion and occupation by Imperial Japan. Jacobin-leaning strikers have ground what little industry we have to a halt, and the Imperial Court fear that even our own military may not be entirely loyal."
  korea.1.a:0 "Order the military to get these riots under control!"
  korea.1.b:0 "Offer to negotiate"

  korea.2.t:0 "Breaking the Protests"
  korea.2.d:0 "The Korean Army was deployed successfully in Seoul, however our officers on the ground report that their methods for defeating the protests are proving less than effective. Nonlethal means of routing the protests are continuously failing to produce meaningful results, however allowing our troops to use live rounds runs the risk of galvanizing the protests against us. "
  korea.2.a:0 "Order the use of live munitions"
  korea.2.b:0 "We will not murder our own people!"

  korea.3.t:0 "The Korean Revolution"
  korea.3.d:0 "Blood spilt in the streets of Seoul did little to end the protests. If anything, they further deepened the crisis. After mere hours of intense violence, the military soon turned on itself. Soliders began murdering or arresting their own officers, unwilling to kill any more of their own countrymen. By the early morning, the Army had entirely turned against the Royal government.\n\nSensing the writing on the wall, Yi Un evacuated the capital ahead of the encroaching military. With the King having unofficially abdicated and fled to parts unknown, a new military provisional government was formed. Lee Beom-Seok, head of the anti-monarchist officer clique, announced to crowds in Seoul the creation of a Korean Republic and that democratic elections are soon to follow. The ancient Korean dynasties are over, and now the future of the peninsula is in the hands of the people."
