 AME_Last_Light_Liberty_desc:0 “‘Liberty is dead’\n‘Liberalism is the guise of Imperialism’\n‘We will bury you’\n\nAll these are phrases hurled at us and our institutions that guarantee an equality and prosperity unknown throughout the world. America has become the last bastion, a final flame in a world of darkness, of a world filled with monsters like Doriot and his henchmen, like Hashimoto and his goons, like the Tsar and his guards. Sadly, men like these have become the norm in our globe. Democracy has been in retreat for the past two decades, liberalism is on its last legs, radicalism and hatred has overtaken the globe, all of these are symptoms of what many have begun to call the ‘Winter of Liberty’.\n\nEvery continent has felt the grip of one horrible ideology or another; East Asia is dominated by the Jacobins and their endless anti-revolutionary purges, Europe is enslaved by France who has turned the home of the Second Renaissance into a dystopian nightmare; and Russia has infected all manners of countries from Iran to Brazil with their ideology of despotism and imperialism.\n\nIf we wish to see liberalism weather this ‘Winter of Liberty’ and survive to the spring,, then we must guide and protect as one does to an infant. §BWe are Liberty’s Sword and Shield, we are Liberty's Last Line of Defense, we are Liberty’s Last Light.§!”

 #Megacorps Foci#
 AME_Megacorp_Wars:0 "The Megacorp Wars"
 AME_Megacorp_Wars_desc:0 "The most pivotal action undertaken during the Coolidge Ministry was undeniably the rekindling of the Megacorp Wars. After lying dormant for decades, the megacorporations found themselves embroiled in intense conflict once again, this time with fresh contenders, novel domains, and significantly higher stakes. Every sector, spanning from oil production to computer innovation, witnessed an unprecedented surge in productivity as each megacorporation vied to slash prices, maximize profits, and introduce groundbreaking goods and technologies to the market. This rapid expansion spurred immense economic growth and ushered in a wave of technological advancement, with industry giants like IBM, Intel, and EIEC engaging in fierce battles within the Chip Wars. Simultaneously, EIEC and Standard Oil engaged in the largest oil production surge in history, each striving to uncover new oil fields, enhance operational efficiency, and innovate oil synthesis methodologies in order to outproduce the other.\n\nHowever, the ramifications of the Megacorp Wars transcend mere factory floors and research laboratories, reaching into boardrooms spanning from Melbourne to Boston, permeating households across America, and pervading the very core of political affairs in Philadelphia. Unfortunately, the casualties in this conflict have been the American economy and, above all, the American people, who have borne the brunt of collateral damage in the power struggles between these corporate titans. Small-scale shop owners have all but vanished from the marketplace, ousted by megacorporations flooding the market with inexpensive, cutting-edge products. Automation has precipitated widespread unemployment, compelling scores of Americans to roam the streets in search of employment opportunities. Concurrently, corruption has become endemic, with megacorporate funds finding their way into the pockets of politicians.\n\nThe far-reaching consequences of the Megacorp Wars have left an indelible scar on America, and prospects for a peace appear increasingly remote."

 AME_Gairenomics_desc:0 "Gair has unveiled his all-encompassing economic agenda to the public; it has been swiftly christened 'Gairenomics' by influential voices within both the administration and the press. At its core, Gairenomics hinges upon deregulation, tax alleviations targeting the middle class and corporations, and a pronounced escalation in military spending to protect American interests abroad.\n\nDeregulation stands tall as the cornerstone of Gairenomics, symbolizing a return to the American spirit that once steered the Second Renaissance and which Gair envisions leading the nation into a resplendent third. Its endorsement has elicited resounding applause from corporations nationwide, heralding it as a catalyst for economic vitality, innovation, and rejuvenation of a sluggish market. Nonetheless, apprehensions loom large as concerns burgeon over potential corporate greed. Many fear an unchecked dominance by mega-corporations that have already displaced countless Americans through widespread automation. The American Workers’ Party has seized upon these anxieties, characterizing the plan as a betrayal of America's citizenry to the clutches of mega-corporate interests—a charge Gair vehemently refutes.\n\nThe tax reductions, met with widespread public acclaim, has been heralded as a boon to personal standards of living, with the additional benefit of propelling economic growth by empowering people with more disposable income for desired purchases. However, the American Unity Party has quietly questioned the trade-off, pondering whether the anticipated economic upswing from tax cuts would offset the resultant deficit and mounting national debt.\n\nHowever, the most contentious point of argument emerged with the monumental surge in military spending. Both the American Workers’ Party and American Unity Party have framed the surge as a detriment—allegedly siphoning resources away from essential social programs that Americans rely upon, or as an unwarranted squandering of American wealth, respectively. Nonetheless, Gair garners steadfast support from a populace gripped by the fear of losing ground in the Cold War; a populace that have witnessed the erosion of democracy in the face of resurging Neo-Imperialism and Jacobinism.\n\nThe implications of Gairenomics remain enigmatic and the issue has become among the most divisive in recent American history. Whether for better or worse, the echoes of Gairenomics are poised to reverberate through the nation, leaving a permanent mark on the nation's trajectory."
