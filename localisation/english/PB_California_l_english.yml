  PB_CAL_Revolutionary_Legacy:0 "Legacy of the Revolution"
  PB_CAL_Revolutionary_Legacy_desc:0 "The Republic of California was born in a blaze of violence out of the Northern Revolution. With the fatherland in the South unable to even save itself, it fell to the revolutionaries in the North to protect the Nortemexicanos. Even decades later, the embers of the revolution still burn just as brightly as they once did. If the time comes and the Empire returns to take back what they believe is theirs, the people of California will be ready."
  PB_CAL_Oil_Boom:0 "The California Oil Boom"
  PB_CAL_Oil_Boom_desc:0 "Alongside Tejas, California is a major exporter of oil in North America. Coupled with strong trade relations with Europe and the Great Powers, California has carved out an extremely profitable oil industry. In the last decade, this has prompted a full blown oil boom as investors flock to California and Tejas in the wake of European downturn, with new facilities popping up all the time and creating millions of jobs."
  PB_CAL_California_Agriculture:0 "Californian Agriculture"
  PB_CAL_California_Agriculture_desc:0 "California is, indisputably, one of the most dominant agricultural powers in the Americas. Alone, the citrus and fruits industries employ nearly a third of the nation's job-holders. Everything from strawberries and almonds to grapes and lemons are exported from the green fields of California. In practical terms, this means that California holds a natural economic dominance over certain aspects of American trade."
  PB_CAL_Dreams_of_Unification:0 "Dreams of Unification"
  PB_CAL_Dreams_of_Unification_desc:0 "During the Northern Revolution, proposals were on the table to unify the disparate Mexican states into a single government. At the time, these ideas were shelved for the sake of revolutionary cohesion. Now, however, there is an overwhelming sense among Californians that the time for true unification has come. With the fatherland nearing collapse and the likelihood of a North American war in the future, California seeks to bring together the hispanic peoples of the former Mexican Empire once more into a United State."
