PBCity.1.t:0 "British Troops march through Paris"
PBCity.1.d:0 "Paris, the city of Romance and the heart of the French nation, has fallen to continued British war effort. While many in the French government feared the idea of British troops marching through the champs Élysées, only a few thought of it as a possible reality due to the optimistic and romantic nationalism of the French party. With British soldiers now occupying the city, streetfighting and urban warfare has become a small thorn in the paw of the lion. The British have already arrested hundreds of [FRA.GetLeader]'s followers and several thousands have yet to be properly found by British military authorities."
PBCity.1.a:0 "How long will this war last?"
PBCity.1.b:0 "Our boys will end this war!"
PBCity.1.c:0 "Paris has fallen, France has not!"

PBCity.2.t:0 "Fall of Madrid"
PBCity.2.d:0 "For the second time in the history of Spain are American soldiers walking on Madrid soil during war. The city of Madrid, capital of Spain and the heart of Castillian nationalism, has fallen after a long military campaign in Iberia. The fall of Madrid has been celebrated by many across the commonwealth, as everyone remembers the later effects of Spanish capitulation had on the French war effort during the First Great War. The photos and films of the American soldiers that have captured the city have spread like wildfire in both Europe and America."
PBCity.2.a:0 "Interesting"
PBCity.2.b:0 "American power saves the day once again"
PBCity.2.c:0 "We will not let the Americans have their victory!"

PBCity.3.t:0 "Fall of Moscow"
PBCity.3.d:0 "After a long and hard campaign, Germany celebrates their recent victory against the Russian Empire at the battle of Moscow. After days of seiging and urban warfare, the city of Moscow has finally fallen into German hands. The Russian army, using a page out of their earlier wars against Napoleon, burned most of the old imperial city to the ground as to ensure a bitter victory for the Germans. \n\nThe German army has already begun to build up the defenses of Moscow as to defend against a Russian counterattack and the logistics of supplying the German armed forces in Moscow."
PBCity.3.a:0 "Napoleon, eat your heart out"
PBCity.3.b:0 "Germany continues to march on"
PBCity.3.c:0 "We'll beat them back!"

PBCity.4.t:0 "The Fall of Paris"
PBCity.4.d:0 "After days of intense fighting, [16.Controller.GetAdjective] troops have broken through French defensive lines into Paris. House-to-house fighting across near-ancient Parisian neighborhoods effectively leveled the city, with French forces staging a last stand against the invaders in the Les Invalides. [16.Controller.GetAdjective] and French engagements continue throughout the darkness of the Catacombs.\n\nAbove, the Eiffel Tower continues to stand like a tombstone over the smoldering ruins of France's once proud capital."
PBCity.4.a:0 "How terrible"
PBCity.4.b:0 "Paris is lost, for now."

PBCity.5.t:0 "The Fall of London"
PBCity.5.d:0 "For the first time since the Norman Invasion, foreign troops marched into the British capital of London. [126.Controller.GetAdjective] forces pushed down the Thames, meeting fierce resistance from retreating British forces.\n\n[126.Controller.GetAdjective] commanders announced their victory from a provisional command post established in the newly conquered Buckingham Palace while [126.Controller.GetAdjective] soldiers posed for propaganda photos in front of the partially collapsed Houses of Parliament. The Royal Family has, reportedly, been evacuated to Scotland."
PBCity.5.a:0 "Thus falls the British Empire"
PBCity.5.b:0 "We will never surrender"

PBCity.6.t:0 "The Fall of Frankfurt"
PBCity.6.d:0 "[55.Controller.GetAdjective] forces took Frankfurt this morning, with German forces surrendering to spare the city from a lengthy siege. The city, now firmly under the command of the [55.Controller.GetAdjective] army, could only watch in horror as foreign soldiers marched through the streets.\n\nThe German capital, once host to the German legislature and government, is now merely just another city under [55.Controller.GetAdjective] occupation. The German government, along with the Kaiser, have fled North to a new provisional capital."
PBCity.6.a:0 "Germany's days may be numbered"
PBCity.6.b:0 "No retreat, No surrender."

PBCity.7.t:0 "The Fall of Tokyo"
PBCity.7.d:0 "Reports indicate that Tokyo has fallen to assaulting [282.Controller.GetAdjective] forces. Once the shining capital of the Japanese Empire, the city had lived through the bloody days of the Japanese Civil War only to fall to outside invaders.\n\nIn spite of the withdrawal of Japanese forces, the city remains in a state of perpetual conflict as fanatical Japanese apparatchiks resist the [282.Controller.GetAdjective] occupation at all costs. The city remains consumed in a cycle of rabid, horrific violence by both sides."
PBCity.7.a:0 "So much for the revolution"
PBCity.7.b:0 "We will fight to the bloody end."

PBCity.8.t:0 "The Fall of Melbourne"
PBCity.8.d:0 "The major industrial Mid-western city of Melbourne fell to Continental forces today. Frantic reports indicate that despite the fact that many Commonwealth troops fought to the bitter end, the unrelenting waves of our superior armies were simply too much to allow for any centralized defense plan to be put into action. While there are still some Commonwealth soldiers fighting against Continental liberation any hopes of Commonwealth forces retaking the city seem unlikely."
PBCity.8.a:0 "One city at a time boys."

PBCity.9.t:0 "The Fall of Baltimore"
PBCity.9.d:0 "After a long drawn out battle the city of Baltimore has finally fallen under our control. While some may reject Continental authority already efforts are well under way to find these state enemies and ensure that no further destabilizing actions take place whilst we continue our advance eastwards further into Commonwealth territory."
PBCity.9.a:0 "Philly will soon be ours."

PBCity.10.t:0 "The Fall of Philadelphia"
PBCity.10.d:0 "Philadelphia, the capital of the United Commonwealth, has collapsed under its own weight to our armies. In a short ceremony Butler announced to a crowd within the now ruined Parliament building that the fall of the Commonwealth and its crumbling armies was soon to take place and that any who still supported such a regime would swiftly be dealt with. While some in the crowd remained silent or openly protested such a statement many cheered and praised Butler for his heroic accomplishment. Troops paraded around city blocks and just as the crowds grew larger and larger the need to quickly rotate troops back to the front lines would take place. Convoys as far as the eyes could see would be filled to the brim with joyous men who had only the shortest opportunity to engage with friends and family they hadn’t since in years, just to be thrown back into the trucks they happily ran out of in a moments notice."
PBCity.10.a:0 "And they said it couldn't be done."

PBCity.11.t:0 "The Fall of New York"
PBCity.11.d:0 "The city of corruption has been overrun by our unstoppable armies. Few loyalist remain within the city, on a handfull of militia men have barricaded themselves within certain city blocks but efforts are already under way to root out the last of these soldiers. The time will soon come where all Americans will be free from Commonwealth oppression. "
PBCity.11.a:0 "Our struggles are not yet over! Keep pushing and don't turn back."

PBCity.12.t:0 "The Fall of Boston"
PBCity.12.d:0 "The city of Boston has, after many days of ferocious close quarters combat, come under our complete and total control. What remains of the Commonwealth government is yet unknown, but many are confident that the Commonwealth threat has largely been pacified. While there are still some hostile units present within the countryside it is only a matter of days before these enemy divisions kneel to our demands. Vae Victis."
PBCity.12.a:0 "Any day now they will be begging for mercy."
