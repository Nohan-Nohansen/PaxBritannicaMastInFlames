 america.1.t:0 "Hoffen"
 america.1.d:0 ""Let's work on your English, Elisabeth,"" he gently encouraged.\n\nThe girl responded with a quiet nod, shifting her eyes from the cityscape to the page before her.\n\n"Wollon," he pronounced, emphasizing the word. "It means want."\n\nElisabeth concentrated, her small fingers tracing the letters. "Hoffen," she repeated softly, learning the word for hope.\n\n"Doctor," he enunciated, shifting to another word. "Ärztin," he added, providing the German equivalent.\n\nThe room was filled with a sense of quiet diligence, father and daughter engrossed in the language lesson. As Elisabeth's understanding grew, her confidence blossomed.\n\n"Can we joy the view, Vater?" she attempted, the sentence forming on her lips.\n\nHe smiled warmly at her progress. "Very close, my dear. It's 'Can we enjoy the view, Father.'"\n\nShe closed the book as Philadelphia stole their attention. The view of the city was breathtaking. Philadelphia gleamed like a city perched on a hill, a promised land they had long yearned for. It was the beacon that kept them going, even as others around them succumbed, whether at the hands of the SP or their own. They both struggled to forget. Memories of those left behind in Hamburg weighed on his mind; she held onto thoughts of her doll, taken by an SP officer as a cruel show of force, and her friend, found dead the night before they departed. Despite it all, they summoned the strength to cast these thoughts aside, focusing instead on the resplendent cityscape ahead — an emblem of hope amidst a world shrouded in darkness.\n\n"Let’s go, Elisabeth," the name always evoked thoughts of her mother. They disembarked the gangplank and, as if guided by an invisible hand, drew a deep breath. The air itself tasted different here, imbued with a taste of freedom."

 america.2.t:0 "Enttäuschung"
 america.2.d:0 "The first thing that struck him as he pushed open the creaking door was the unmistakable odor. It was a stale, musty scent that spoke volumes of neglect, a room frozen in time since the Great War, and the first one at that. He flinched as he felt a swift movement graze past his foot, followed by his daughter Elisabeth's piercing scream. Glancing down, he found relief in the sight of a rat scurrying away. He couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it. The terror etched on Elisabeth's face, however, was a stark reminder of how profoundly their lives had been scarred by the brutality of the SP.\n\nThe rat made a swift escape as he attempted to crush it with his well-worn boot, a relic from Hannover. It could hardly be deemed a boot anymore; the once-sturdy material had long since surrendered to time's relentless grasp. It clung to his foot as if by sheer will, a tattered fragment that had somehow persisted through the years.\n\nHe let his mind wander back to the moment he had breathed in the air of Philadelphia, a breath laced with hope, a sensation so foreign and distant that he had almost failed to recognize it. The air he drew into his lungs now, in the heart of Melbourne, bore no resemblance. It carried a weight of disappointment, a palpable departure of the optimism he once held dear.\n\nWith tenderness, he tucked Elisabeth into the solitary bed in the room. As he lay beside her, his thoughts strayed to the ideals of hope and prosperity he had carried across continents, only to find them dashed against the harsh reality of America's unmet promises. The weight of disillusionment pressed upon him, a testament to how his expectations had been betrayed by the very land he had sought solace in."

 america.3.t:0 "Auftrag"
 america.3.d:0 "Erdmann wandered the bustling streets of Melbourne, his gaze shifting from one shop window to another, searching for that elusive 'We're Hiring' sign. His last job had slipped through his fingers, lost in a whirlwind of change and progress. To be honest, he couldn't quite put a name to what replaced him, only that he and most of his colleagues were dismissed shortly after it arrived. Before that job, it was a machine that could do twice the work at half the cost. His tale was all too familiar, a narrative shared by thousands. Work had grown scarcer, as automation relentlessly edged out human hands. In Melbourne, this was a harsh reality, a relentless cycle of unemployment and mechanization that dated back to the Automation Crisis in the old British Empire.\n\n1933... the year echoed in his thoughts. Erdmann strained to recall his childhood, the memories distant and faint. The arithmetic reminded him that he was just seven. Back then, he could leisurely wander the streets of Hamburg with his mother, not glancing around to check if an SP officer lurked nearby, snuffing out the life of any German pedestrian at their whim. Back then, Germany could call itself the hegemon of Europe, not bothering to look below to the revanchist France or behind to the Russian monster. It was a golden age, a time of abundance. Then the French tore it all away, piece by piece. They—\n\nThe symphony of urban sounds jolted him back to reality. He couldn't afford to dwell in the past. The urgency to secure a job hung heavy in the air. For without one, he and his daughter would face the unthinkable choice between sustenance and shelter. So, he pressed on, each step a testament to his determination. He walked, and walked, and walked."

 america.4.d:0 "Elisabeth’s face acquainted itself with the earth in a most unpleasant manner, a courtesy she could attribute exclusively to the boy lurking behind her. She attempted to rise, only to be greeted by a sharp pang in her ribs.\n\n“Say something, Fritz,” one of the boys taunted.\n\n“Ja, say za thing,” another chimed in, mocking her German accent.\n\nShe chose not to correct them, refraining from informing them that her name was Elisabeth. It wasn't a matter of defiance, but perhaps the residue of her conditioning under the SP's regime, as her father often asserted. He maintained that she was a radiant source of joy, a second sun, to all who knew her. Yet, after she underwent the state-mandated 'education,' she felt estranged from him. There was a divide between them, a chasm he couldn't traverse. Maybe he risked their lives in their escape in the hope of forging a closer bond with his daughter. Regardless of his motives, Elisabeth's time in America hadn't unfolded as the dream her father had promised. She felt hollow. She wa—\n\nElisabeth’s train of thought was abruptly derailed by the second encounter her face had with the ground that day. Unlike the previous instance, there were no accompanying kicks to her side. The boys, it seemed, had grown tired of her stoic responses and moved on to torment another student. She rose, inspecting her scraped knees and elbows. She wondered what she would tell her father. She decided that she would have to inform her father that she had simply tripped on her way home. She trudged forward, her knee stinging, and she walked, and walked, and walked."

 america.5.d:0 "Erdmann and Elisabeth settled comfortably into the car as Erdmann deftly navigated through the bustling streets of downtown Melbourne on the way to their eagerly anticipated new home. They had endured the same cramped apartment for the past few years, bearing witness to their neighbors' nightly disputes, struggling to navigate a space meant for storage, not human habitation. Finally, it seemed, their fortunes were about to change. They were on the verge of realizing the American dream that had been promised to them.\n\nAs he executed a sharp turn, their new home came into view, conveniently situated near his fresh workplace. The view was as captivating as the first sight of Philadelphia all those years ago. He stole a glance at his daughter, hoping to see a spark of youthful excitement and curiosity, but she remained stoic. It was as if an impenetrable barrier separated them, and this realization frustrated him immensely. His anger wasn't directed at her, but at those who had shaped her into this distant, emotionless figure. He released a weary sigh. It seemed the dream was only halfway fulfilled — wealth without happiness. With determination, he pressed on toward the elusive dream."
