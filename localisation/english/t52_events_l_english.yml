# WESTPHALIAN EVENTS 
######################
 westphalia.1.t:0 "Volksmilizen"
 westphalia.1.d:0 "The division of the German people is largely viewed as unnatural by the general population and only necessitated by temporary ideological and political differences: Prussia has lost track of German values and has endorsed a path to a totalitarian superstate without civil rights, the Rhenish Republic is democratic in nature, but controlled by France through agents of the French Republic in key government oversight positions, and Bavaria finally is currently controlled by an insane obsession with neo-marxist idealism.\n\nWestphalia stands a solid middle ground between these states: Independent from outside forces, with a government that is still democratic enough to deal with France and their Rhenish allies, however not so far aligned to western culture and liberal idealism to irritate the Prussians. The Bavarians meanwhile see themselves deeply ideologically divided from both Prussia and Westphalia, however recognize that they would not be able to survive armed struggle against either of them, forcing them to pursue an at least acceptable diplomatic relationship with Westphalia in order to stop an alliance between their two northern neighbors.\n\nThe Westphalian population meanwhile sees itself far closer to Prussia than they do to Bavaria, with the Westphalians going out of their way to accept tens of thousands of Bavarian refugees fleeing from their far-left government. The border between Westphalia and Bavaria is partially militarized, but both countries fear Prussia's neo-imperialism more than they do each other, thus leaving the shared border regions somewhat easy to cross.\n\nWhile the Westphalian military staff is primarily concerned with Prussia though, the Bavarian refugees and their far-right supporters within the Westphalian population and government are not. They have begun the formation of loose paramilitary forces at the Bavarian-Westphalian border. These 'Volksmilizen' (peoples' militias) regularly attack Bavarian checkpoints in partisan warfare and help refugees cross the border.\n\nThe Bavarian government has signalled that these attacks need to stop if the current relationship between the two countries is to continue."
 westphalia.1.o1:0 "The Volksmilizen are of no concern to us."
 westphalia.1.o2:0 "Coordinated police actions are in order."
 westphalia.2.t:0 "Jodl's Speech"
 westphalia.2.d:0 "The Bavarian refugees in Westphalia mostly act according to their economic class: Whereas lower class migrants generally either become factory workers in the major cities of Westphalia or settle as farmers in Hesse, close to the Bavarian border where they can subsequently become Volksmiliz partisans, former Bavarians of more noble lineage have found more sophisticated and less violent ways to lead the struggle to reclaim Bavaria.\n\nOne of these upper class Bavarians is Alfred Jodl, son of a pre-socialist Bavarian officer, who fled from Munich in the early days of the revolution, eventually finding work in the young Westphalian military. He has shown himself as one of Westphalia's finest military tacticians and has commanded the now defunct Infanterie-Division 'Hannover' between 1924 and 1929.\n\nHowever, Jodl has shown himself as not only militarily talented but also as politically active and has emerged as one of the main founders of the "Bayrische Gesellschaft", the Bavarian Society. This political lobby, politically close to DP, DKP and Zentrum, has become one of the most prominent political movements in just two months of its existance since its inception on November 29th, 1935.\n\nJodl has gained a lot of attention as the most prominent face of the Bavarians in exile in Westphalia - and has been declared a persona non grata by the Bavarian government on December 2nd.\n\nToday, Jodl held a landmark speech about how German reunification could only happen as a compromise between Prussia and Westphalia to unite into a reborn German state - and that that compromise could only come into being upon the destruction of Bavarian socialism.\n\nThe Bavarian government has sent us an urgent and secret message to immediately and publically disendorse Jodl's political message and to warn him to not get political again or to face dishonorable discharge."
 westphalia.2.o1:0 "Ignore the secret message."
 westphalia.2.o2:0 "Deliver the ultimatum to Jodl."
 westphalia.3.t:0 "Thuringian Elections: DP Victory"
 westphalia.3.d:0 "Although the federal government of Westphalia is still rather authoritarian in nature, many of the local parliaments are still formed and run in fairly democratic processes.\n\nThe state of Thuringia, vital due to its strategic location between Bavaria, Prussia and Westphalia, has last assembled a new parliament in February of 1931, and the five-year term of the ruling DP government is coming to an end.\n\nMinister President Erwin Baum was able to convince the voters with his largely successful taxation and agricultural policies, with the DP gaining 41% of the vote. Baum opened coalition talks with both the DKP (13%) and the Zentrumspartei (11%). A DP-DKP coalition was quickly agreed upon and is set to run Thuringia's local parliament until 1941."
 westphalia.3.o1:0 "A victory for Mackensen's followers."
 westphalia.4.t:0 "Thuringian Elections: Zentrum Victory"
 westphalia.4.d:0 "Although the federal government of Westphalia is still rather authoritarian in nature, many of the local parliaments are still formed and run in fairly democratic processes.\n\nThe state of Thuringia, vital due to its strategic location between Bavaria, Prussia and Westphalia, has last assembled a new parliament in February of 1931, and the five-year term of the ruling DP government is coming to an end.\n\nErwin Baum's policy choices as Minister President were not solid enough to gain another mandate, with the DP only achieving 24% of the vote. The clear winner of the election was the CWB, the Christliches Wahlbündnis, a makeshift alliance between the catholic Zentrumspartei and the local protestant Thüringer Volkspartei. The CWB gained 40% of the electorate, proceeding to enter a coalition with DDP (6%) and DKP (5%). This "Mitte-Rechts-Bündnis", 'center-right alliance', is set to rule Thuringia until 1941. Herbert Eckstein of the Thüringer Volkspartei is to lead the government as the new Minister President. On a federal level, this will mainly be useful to the Zentrumspartei."
 westphalia.4.o1:0 "A victory for Christian conservatives."
 westphalia.5.t:0 "Thuringian Elections: SPD Victory"
 westphalia.5.d:0 "Although the federal government of Westphalia is still rather authoritarian in nature, many of the local parliaments are still formed and run in fairly democratic processes.\n\nThe state of Thuringia, vital due to its strategic location between Bavaria, Prussia and Westphalia, has last assembled a new parliament in February of 1931, and the five-year term of the ruling DP government is coming to an end.\n\nMinister President Erwin Baum's term as government leader was apparantly nothing short of disastrous, as his policies of minimalization of government and tax cuts for the wealthy was punished, especially by the working people, with a pathetic 18% of the vote, compared to 37% in 1931. The big winner of the election was the SPD, which gained a stunning 44%, a result even more impressive considering that the DSAP was also a major player in the election, draining far-left votes away from the Social Democrats. DSAP and SPD quickly agreed on pursuing a "Linksfront-Koalition", Left Front Coalition, with SPD member Kurt Böhme as Minister President."
 westphalia.5.o1:0 "A left-wing victory."
 westphalia.6.t:0 "Thuringian Elections: Hung Parliament"
 westphalia.6.d:0 "Although the federal government of Westphalia is still rather authoritarian in nature, many of the local parliaments are still formed and run in fairly democratic processes.\n\nThe state of Thuringia, vital due to its strategic location between Bavaria, Prussia and Westphalia, has last assembled a new parliament in February of 1931, and the five-year term of the ruling DP government is coming to an end.\n\nThe electoral results were nothing short of disastrous for the future of the republic. The DP gained 26%, the conservative electoral pact of local protestants and the catholic Zentrumspartei gained 24%, the SPD also gained 24%, all other factions stand around 5% or lower.\n\nIn order to secure government stability, the DP will probably enter a government with the Christian democrats - even though both factions promised their voters that that would not happen prior to the election.\n\nThis result will make no one happy."
 westphalia.6.o1:0 "This will help the extremists."
 westphalia.7.t:0 "Foundation of the Royal Society of Thuringia"
 westphalia.7.d:0 "The establishment of the DP-DKP coalition in Thuringia marked the first time since the end of a Zentrum-DKP coalition in Sleswig in early 1934 that the DKP is part of one of the state parliaments. This caused an immediate surge of DKP organization efforts in Thuringia, aiming to establish the new possible political foothold.\n\nAs the DKP focusses on Christian conservatism and monarchist nostalgia, the party is actively looking for both clerical and noble support for its cause. The foundation of the Royal Society of Thüringia marks an important milestone in the German monarchists' efforts to restore the disgraced Hohenzollern line to the currently defunct German throne.\n\nThe Royal Society has its most prominent member in Karl-August von Sachsen-Weimar-Eisenach, the eldest son of the last Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.\n\nKarl-August, internationally sometimes referred to as Charles Augustus, aims to establish a newly formed Kingdom of Thuringia with himself as king in the case of a restoration of the German Empire."
 westphalia.7.o1:0 "The monarchists continue to organize."
 westphalia.8.t:0 "The Frick rally"
 westphalia.8.d:0 "Wilhelm Frick, Thuringian state leader of the DVLP, has today held a landmark rally for the ultranationalist Fatherland Party.\n\nFrick, in presence of party leader Hugenberg, has celebrated his party's triumphal success in the recent state election that managed to torpedo the democratic process by forcing an unwanted coalition on both the politicians and the voters.\n\nFrick reiterated that the country of Westphalia had to cease to exist as soon as possible and rejoin Wolfgang Kapp's Prussia.\n\nHugenberg held the closing remarks of the rally, promising to his followers a Prussian-Westphalian union that would lead a destructive and glorious war on socialist Bavaria."
 westphalia.8.o1:0 "Let them play their little games."
