    PB_CHI_Peking_Conference:0 "Legacy of the Peking Conference"
    PB_CHI_Peking_Conference_desc:0 "The First Peking Conference was held in 1868 following the negotiated end of the Taiping Rebellion. The Conference was attended by a myriad of European powers, but most importantly it was another battleground between British and Russian influences. The most important part of the Conference was the official division of China under international law, with the Taiping Rebels and the Qing Empire forced to coexist as North and South China, officially referred to as “China-Peking” and “China-Tianjing”. Additionally, the Conference granted sweeping extraterritorial concessions to the European powers and forced both Chinas to acknowledge the independence of the Dali Sultanate.\n\nThis status quo was carefully maintained by the Chinese Reconstruction Administration, an organization managed by the principal European powers that first promulgated the Conference. Following the Russian invasion of Manchuria during the Great War, the CRA was reorganized into the Quadrilateral Commission, consisting of the United Kingdom, United Commonwealth, German Empire, and the Netherlands. The later collapse of the Qing Empire complicated affairs, however the intervention of Commission forces helped prevent the Revolutionaries from sweeping South into the moribund Southern empire."

  PB_CHI_Warlords:0 "Managing Warlordism"
  PB_CHI_Warlords_desc:0 "\nThe hands-off domestic policies of the Qing Empire, while they have bought stability in the short term, have severely hampered the country in the long term. Many provinces are ruled over as independent states in all but name by local governors and military cliques. The ultimate result of this is that the nation is deeply splintered along ideological, ethnic, and economic lines. Not every warlord is aligned to the central Peking government, which could prove precarious in the long term if not rectified.\n\n§YWarlord Alignment§! is an indication of which political faction, if any, a warlord is aligned with.\n\n§YWarlord Power§! indicates how much local authority a warlord holds over their native province, which can be leveraged against the government that controls said province."

  CHI_Pacify_Guangxi:0 "Pacify Guangxi"
  CHI_Pacify_Guangxi_desc:0 "The Guangxi and Guangdong Region of Southern China was one of the central hubs of the Revolutionaries during the conflict. Even now, former revolutionaries hide out in the countryside, attacking the local Qing garrison and damaging infrastructure. They must be dealt with, however the continuing popularity of the revolutionaries and their entrenched positions will make this campaign a costly one."
  CHI_Pacify_Yunnan:0 "Pacify Yunnan"
  CHI_Pacify_Yunnan_desc:0 "The Yunnan Province was the central hub of the aborted Chinese uprisings, and thus it is one of the most highly defended territories we control. The province's position on the periphery of the Empire has made it difficult to control, but even now the insurgency draws strength from Burmese and ethnic rebels across the porous border. This region must be brought back under the complete control of the Empire."
  CHI_Pacify_Sichuan:0 "Pacify Sichuan"
  CHI_Pacify_Sichuan_desc:0 "Though Sichuan joined the Revolutionary alliance, their allegiance to them was more pragmatic than ideological. Due to this, the region's population has done little to help the insurgent revolutionaries. It will be significantly easier to take this territory back from the Republicans, and we should retake it before we attempt to assault their strongholds in the South."

  qing.1.d:0 "Today marks the beginning of Chinese New Year, and as festivities kick off throughout the Empire, disturbing reports have reached imperial authorities. Spies within various nationalist and revolutionary movements have reported that the enigmatic National Revolutionary Alliance group are using the holiday as an opportunity to stockpile explosives and munitions.\n\nThough we haven't confirmed these reports, it may be wise to remain on high alert throughout the holiday on the off chance that these rabble-rousers attempt anything."
  qing.1.a:0 "Surely these reports can't be accurate."

  qing.2.t:0 "Explosions Reported in Wuchang"
  qing.2.d:0 "In the midst of celebrations in Wuchang, a series of explosions were reported near the city center. Police rushed to the scene of the event, discovering multiple warehouses ablaze and nearly a hundred people injured. Though initially it was believed the event was caused by an accidental fireworks explosion, further investigation has found that four warehouses in the city had been stocked to their roofs with military grade materials.\n\nPolice have located at least three other warehouses across the province with similar contents, which has lead General Xun to order the deployment of Imperial troops to Hubei in anticipation of an armed uprising. Police recovered documents from several warehouses which, though badly burned, implicate members of multiple provincial governments in the illegal weapons stockpiling."

  qing.7.d:0 "The situation in Southern China has developed not necessarily to the advantage of Imperial forces. The declaration of martial law did little to curb the ongoing civil unrest. Instead, it simply intensified the fighting between local authorities and the revolutionaries. The streets of dozens of cities are bathed in blood as disorganzied militias and Qing authorities clash in intense urban warfare. Efforts to get the military involved have similarly backfired, as a large number of generals and officers have defected to the revolutionaries.\n\nIncidents are sparking all throughout the nation and it is increasingly clear that the Empire faces her greatest crisis since the Taiping Rebellion. Loyalist forces muster around Field Marshall Sun Chuanfang, while the rebellious forces ally themselves with Cai E and his revolutionary clique. Reports on the periphery of Imperial territory indicate that separatists have launched probing attacks against provincial capitals, indicating the likelihood of general revolt.
