 MIF_AME_Vince_Gair_Desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 02/25/1901\n\n§YVince Gair§!, hailing from a tranquil farming town in Southern Carolina, was born into a Scots-Irish family. His early years were uneventful, during which he worked as an accountant for a local railway. However, in his twenties, he ventured into politics, eventually rising to become the Personal Accountant to the Premier of Southern Carolina. In the early 1930s, his parliamentary bid was met with resounding failure. Despite this setback, he maneuvered his way into the role of Secretary of Financial Affairs for Southern Carolina through favors, smooth talking, and other questionable means. Gair's ascent continued as he vied for the Premier position as the official Progress Party candidate. Presenting himself as the quintessential Southern Carolinian, a man who had risen from humble beginnings and had ascended to the center of state politics through sheer hard work and diligence; he won a close victory in the 1939 elections. As Premier, he initiated sweeping reforms, including mandated work safety measures, paid sick leave, and the outlawing of strikebreakers. While his reforms were deemed drastic by many, especially those affiliated with the megacorporation, Gair maintained unwavering popularity among the unions and workers. Securing a second term in 1943, he solidified his status as a pivotal political figure in the United American Republic. He continued enacting reforms, including the South Carolina Workmens’ Act, which reduced shifts to a maximum of eight hours. However, the term also witnessed the repeal of many of Gair’s prior reforms by members of both the American Unity Party and Progress Party who believed he had gone too far. Gair, it seemed, agreed, as he put up no resistance. Upon reaching his term limit, he opted not to run for SC Premier again, believing that the young republic needed a Cincinnatus, not a Caesar.\n\nDespite his withdrawal from South Carolina politics, he was selected by Progress Party nominee Earl Warren as his Vice Presidential nominee. Warren sought to secure support among Southern voters and the labor force. However, Earl Warren, a conservative-leaning member of the Progress Party, prohibited him from advocating for reform. So Vince Gair, once the champion of the workers, began to give speeches advocating for deregulation and unfettered Megacorp policy. It’s unclear when he started to believe the speeches he was giving, but by the time his first term as Vice President was over, Gair the Reformer had given way to Gair the Conservative.\n\nWarren's re-election in 1952 solidified Gair's executive role as well as his pro-megacorp policies. In his second term as Vice President, he announced his bid for the Presidency of the UAR, pledging to restore a pro-corporate, business-friendly America. Despite initial opposition, Gair secured a victory in the 1956 elections. Now, less than a year into his term, he has begun efforts to support corporate interests and streamline IBM, a policy many of his former supporters have begun to disparagingly call ‘Gairenomics’."
