  PB_INA_International_Territory_idea:0 "International Territory"
  PB_INA_International_Territory_idea_desc:0 "The Concessions Zone was carved out of the former French colonial Empire and consists almost solely of a few cities and the Rif region. Due to the international nature of the Zone, raising a national army is naturally impossible. At the same time, the Commissioners leading the Zone represent the interests of the colonial nations involved, and thus expect a certain degree of our trade to be exported. Between contradictory regulations and asinine laws, the Zone isn't so much administrated as it is kept on life support."
  PB_INA_Algerian_Nationalist_Strongholds:0 "Algerian Nationalist Strongholds"
  PB_INA_Algerian_Nationalist_Strongholds_desc:0 "During the twilight years of the French Empire, when their African colonies fell to Imperial Powers occupation, there was a brief lived attempt at an independent Algerian state. This was, of course, crushed and the remainder of French Algeria integrated at gunpoint into the British Empire, with Algerian nationalism crushed beneath the Tommy jackboot. Not so in the Concessions Zone, as the disorganized chaotic nature of the territory has allowed a strong Algerian nationalist movement to take root."
  PB_INA_Rif_Unrest:0 "Unrest in the Rif"
  PB_INA_Rif_Unrest_desc:0 "Alongside the failed independent Algeria, French Morocco was also the site of would-be revolutionary fervor. The tribes of the Rif region continue to resist international rule. The regio, originally added into the Concessions due to disputes between Britain and Portugal, has become a hotbed of revolutionary activity. If we intend to conduct any form of meaningful conscription, then the Rif must be pacified."
