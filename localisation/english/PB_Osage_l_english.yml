PB_OSA_Missionary_Movement_desc:0 "Ever since the United Commonwealth came to border the territory of the Wazhazhe people, christian missionaries came across the Mississippi in an attempt to impose their religion and culture upon the native Americans. Supported by the protestant churches of the Commonwealth, protestant missionaries came here fully supplied with bibles, wine and farming equipment, intending to show the natives the true, English way of civilization. Their disrespect for the native way of life and nature gave them a reputation of troublemakers and soon, the border was closed to protestant adventurers seeking to travel through Osage territory. \n\nUnlike their protestant brothers, catholic missionaries were far more appealing to the Wazhazhe people. The mysticism and rituals of the catholics was inspiring and touched with some Osage customs and stories, allowing for some natives to syncretize their nature-oriented beliefs with catholic religion. When the 1921 typhus fever came to our land, catholic missionaries and members of the church helped local communities, even dying to keep the starving from suffering more than they needed to. Their kindness, in contrast to the protestant missionaries, and the small popularity catholicism has gathered inside our territory has led the Osage nation to keep the borders open for catholics, maintaining a rather distant relationship with the Papal state."
