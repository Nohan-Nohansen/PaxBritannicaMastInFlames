  ENG_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe United Kingdom§! is the dominant world power in 1933.\n\n A victor in the Great War, Britain retreated into isolationism with the postwar §Y"Long Depression"§! that gripped the global economy. Propping itself up with inter-empire trade, the United Kingdom and her §YImperial Confederation§! have weathered the storm of the interwar relatively unscathed. However, vast speculation bubbles, unstable currency and growing global discontent threaten to undermine Britain's Empire, particularly as tensions continue to rise with the up-and-coming §YAmerican Commonwealth§!.\n\n The United Kingdom now faces threats from a resurgent France and Russia, eager to settle the score from the Great War, as well as conflict within their increasingly precarious Empire and the nation itself.\n\n The United Kingdom is a §YGreat Power§!.\n\n"

  JAP_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Republic of Japan§! is a growing power in East Asia in 1933. \n\n Japan was one of the few nations of Asia to survive the wave of colonialist expansion relatively unmolested. Following a period of intense isolationism, Japan began to open up to Western trade in the mid 1800s with the arrival of French and Dutch trade delegations. Fearing that a failure to modernize might see their nation subjected to the same fate as Imperial China, Japan adopted a series of radical reforms under Emperor Meiji. This period, known as the §YMeiji Restoration§!, saw Japan dramatically modernize and even contest the power of the once unassailable Chinese Empire. \n\n The rising sun, however, fell just as quickly as it ascended. The §YFar Eastern Crisis§! of 1905 saw the outbreak of war between Japan and Russia over influence in Korea and Manchuria. The initially local conflict soon became the spark that lit the powderkeg of the §YGreat War§!. Japan found itself quickly outclassed by the introduction of the British and German navies, leading to a two year long blockade and the ultimate collapse of Japanese operations in continental Asia. Ultimately, Emperor Meiji would see the very empire he helped create collapse in 1909 with the §YTokyo Garrison Rebellion§!. \n\n Spurred by riots over rationing and austerity measures, elements of the Imperial Japanese Army rebelled against the government after orders to break up the protests. Unwilling to murder their compatriots, the IJA turned on their commanders and fired the first shots of §Ythe Japanese Civil War§!. In the ensuing chaos, a provisional democratic government ascended to power alongside the growing Jacobin movement. The conflict saw the burning of the Imperial Palace, armistice with the §YImperial Powers§!, and ultimately the seizure of power by the radical Jacobins of the provisional government. In the ensuing years, Jacobin leadership lead a bloody §YRepublican Terror§!, executing or imprisoning thousands of citizens for supposed imperial sympathies. §YKingoro Hashimoto§! would ascend to power after the overthrow of the Diet in 1911, notable for his defection to the provisional government after the Tokyo Rebellion. Suspending elections with emergency powers, Hashimoto rules Japan as the so-called protector of the revolution. With resurgent Russian expansionism and China on the verge of collapse, Japan now stands poised to lead the people's revolution across Asia and beyond."
  GER_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Empire of Germany§! is the preeminent continental power in Europe in 1933.\n\nEmerging from their defeat in the §YFirst Franco German War§!, the Holy Roman Empire found itself in a state of flux. Wracked by the liberal revolutions following the §YFrench Reformation§!, many within the Empire's Habsburg hegemon feared complete dissolution. Others, however, like Emperor Francis II, saw the defeat as an opportunity. The peoples of Germany had been defeated once, and they would never be defeated again.\n\nThis began the period known as the §YWars of Consolidation§!. Either through agreement or arms, Austria and her allies began the ardous process of centralizing and reforming the Empire. This period of conflict would come to a head with the §YAustro-Prussian War§!. Offering territorial concessions in Poland to Russia in exchange for their assistance, Austria invaded and strangled the nascent Prussian superpower in the crib. With the back of the Hohenzollerns broken, Austria turned her attentions East to Alsace-Lorraine. The §YSecond Franco German War§! saw the Germans avenge their defeat in 1797 and in a lavish ceremony in Versailles, Franz Joseph I was crowned as the first Kaiser of the German Empire.\n\nThis state of affairs proved too much for Austria's own constituencies in Hungary and Illyria, who demanded self-determination from the new German state. The §Y1870 Ausgleich Treaty§! saw Hungary gain independence in all but name, while Austria's southern Slavic provinces were reorganized into the §YDinaric Federation§! as a Dominion of Germany. This state of affairs proved unsustainable with the outbreak of the §YGreat War§!. As Germany fought brutal trench warfare across Flanders and Wallonia, their Hungarian allies collapsed into revolution while the Dinaric Federation broke free in the fervor of Slavic ultranationalism that gripped the Balkans.\n\nThough a victor in the war, Germany decisively lost the peace. The §YLong Depression§!, the postwar collapse of the European economies, fermented political unrest of all kinds. Germany's former Russian ally has gone sour and blames the German hegemon for their postwar decline. Even worse, the resurgent and revanchist French state is seemingly on a collision course for war once more. Only iron and blood will see Germany through these dark days.\n"
  CHI_Country_Desc_Topbar:0 "§YThe Empire of China§! is an empire in decline in 1933\n\nOfficially the Empire of Great Qing, the Manchu-led Chinese state has been in almost constant decline since the first arrival of Europeans. Following the §YManchu Conquest of China§!, the Qing stood as a dominant power in Asia, however decades of mismanagement and isolationism crippled their ability to project power. This would be further exacerbated with the arrival of British interests in the region and, more importantly, the §YOpium Trade§!.\n\nOpium became a major problem throughout the Empire and soon the Qing were forced to act. They began seizing and destroying Opium shipments, a decision that would set them down the path towards the §YFirst Opium War§!. Decisively defeated, the Qing were left humiliated and forced into a series of unequal treaties, effectively carving whole swathes of China into §YSPheres of Influence§!. Peking was unable to catch a break with the rise of Japan as a superpower, and would ultimately lose influence over Korea following a brief conflict. Broken, both militarily and financially, the Qing retreated into a state of isolationism, only able to issue a quiet protest when Manchuria became a battleground during the §YGreat War§!\n\nThe §YInterwar§! years have not been kind to the moribund imperial state. The streets of the Dali and Guangzhou burn with the fires of young revolution, while in the West, the Khans and Uyghurs plot their independence. The greatest threat has come with the rise of the §YNational Revolutionary Alliance§!, a broad underground coalition of nationalists, jacobins and reformists bent on overthrowing the monarchy. Even the allegiance of the military has come into question, as local governors have carved out their provinces into regionalist warlord states just itching to break free. Banditry runs amok, people are starving, the coffers are empty. The Qing Empire is on life support, and it's just a matter of time before the plug is pulled."
