 RUS_conquerors_and_conquered_desc:0 "We were victorious. Our alliance with Paris paid off. We have conquered vast swathes of land on the European continent. We have established many puppet regimes on our western reaches. Russia has restored its glory at the price of many lives. The world stood still to an abruptly silenced bell.\n\nYet in the east the bells still toll. Defeated at the hands of the Japanese and their allies, who were fought viciously on the banks of the Amur and across the Pacific waves. The war was a victory and humiliation in one. The blood of Japanese soldiers will be on our hands once more in the future, and we will, in harmonious glory, stand triumphant on the biggest hill in Tokyo.\nFor the glory of Russia!\n\n§YThe air is full of after-thunder freshness,\nAnd everything rejoices and revives.\nWith the whole outburst of its purple clusters\nThe lilac drinks the air of paradise.\n\nIt is not revolutions and upheavals\nThat clear the road to new and better days,\nBut revelations, lavishness and torments\nOf someone's soul, inspired and ablaze.\n\n-Boris Pasternak, After The Storm.§!"

#water shortage
RUS_kazakhs_1:0 "The Barren Blues"
RUS_kazakhs_1_desc:0 "The Kazakhs are the most peaceful ethnicity in the region, this is because only half of their population lives in the affected areas and thus many Kazakhs moved to those regions instead of staying in the dry and barren desert."
RUS_turkmen_1:0 "Rebbelious 'Republics'"
RUS_turkmen_1_desc:0 "The southern Turkmen have been affected the most by the draining. Many people that used to live on the coast suddenly found themselves far inland with little food and water. These peoples have now founded various Jacobin ‘republics’ across the Khwarezm province. They are more unified than one in the Russian government should hope."
RUS_uzbek_1:0 "Bitter Bukharans"
RUS_uzbek_1_desc:0 "The Uzbeks in Bukhara are the least affected, but the ones in Transoxiana weren’t quite so lucky, and neither were the ones that used to live on the Aral sea and now live in a cold desert. The Uzbeks of the region are unified by an unknown man who proclaims himself Khan of the Uzbeks, and has been a formidable opponent to the Russian garrisons in the area."
RUS_kyrgyz_1:0 "Knavish Kyrgyzstanis"
RUS_kyrgyz_1_desc:0 "The Kyrgyzs have decided to ally themselves with the Chinese revolutionaries and frequently have border clashes with the Sinkiang Administration and also often loot Russian colonial and garrison towns. Making it a rather unattractive location for Russian settlers and newly recruited soldiers. Smuggling is also an issue as the Chinese often smuggle not only weapons but also humans out of and into the Kyrgyz provinces."
RUS_tajik_1:0 "The Thespian Tajiks"
RUS_tajik_1_desc:0 "The Tajiks are the smallest group but also the most radical. They have established so-called ‘Free Republics’ across the province. These republics are Anarchist and Jacobin in nature and have to be eradicated for the glory of Russia."
