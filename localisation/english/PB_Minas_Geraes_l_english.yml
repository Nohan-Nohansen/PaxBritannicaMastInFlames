  PB_MNG_House_of_Braganza:0 "The House of Braganza"
  PB_MNG_House_of_Braganza_desc:0 "The Empire of Brazil gained independence from Portugal in 1821, bringing an end to colonialism in South America. Despite this, relations with the home country remained amiable and thus Brazil retained the House of Braganza as their ruling family. Just over ten years later, however, the Empire came to a catastrophic end. After multiple failed wars and humiliations by their neighbors, Brazil's government descended first into civil war, then into wholesale regional collapse.\n\nThough a rump Imperial state survived the chaos in Minas Gerais, Emperor Pedro II was among the casualties of the chaos, suffering a fatal gunshot wound at the hands of perfidious Jacobins. With his death, a succession of lesser princes and aristocrats fought for control of the throne, ultimately leading to the ascension of Dona Carolina I. The daughter of Princess Paula, Carolina now seeks to return the House of Braganza to power and reunite the discordant Brazilian states."

  PB_MNG_Legacy_of_the_Collapse_desc:0 "The Collapse of the Brazilian Empire was a catastrophic event for South America and completely upended the old order of things. With Brazil disunified, other powers have taken over regions of the former empire, while former states have forged their own path. Brazil has been disunified for almost a century and it will take blood and iron to see the Empire forged anew."
  PB_MNG_Fanatical_Nationalism:0 "Fanatical Nationalism"
  PB_MNG_Fanatical_Nationalism_desc:0 "Carolina's absolutist rule and the reforms of her government have created a population increasingly devoted to nationalistic sentiment. With the increasing stability that the restorationists have brought, a strong foundation of support has grown around the party."
