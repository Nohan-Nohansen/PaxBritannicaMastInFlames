PB_HOL_religious_divide:0 "Protestant-Catholic Divide"
PB_HOL_religious_divide_desc:0 "The Dutch Republic is split between the north and the south, with the great Rhine river as divide. In the north of the Netherlands, protestantism and its values reign supreme. The absolute victory secured during our war of independence coincided with the protestant reformation, with protestant rights being one of the main factors leading to our war of independence. The protestant provinces of the Dutch Republic are clearly favored politically and see most of the economic action. In the north of the nation, catholic idealism and its grand cathedrals are common place, as the northern provinces of Brabant, Limburg and Flanders never joined the protestant side during the independence war. Their resistance would determine the fate of those provinces, becoming the political and economic backwater of the Dutch Republic, untill very recently with catholic emancipation."
PB_HOL_republican_agitation_1:0 "Republican Agitation - §Y(Small)§!" 
PB_HOL_republican_agitation_1_desc:0 "With the Great War acting like a wake-up call for many Dutch citizens, the Neo-Republicans have seen their rise in popularity in their endless pursuit of confronting the old regime of Stadtholderate. Many of their members have taken to the streets in protest of the position of Stadtholder and it seems that the time is nigh for political reform in the Dutch Republic..."
PB_HOL_colonial_empire:0 "Nederlandse Koloniale Rijk"
PB_HOL_colonial_empire_desc:0 "The Dutch Colonial Empire has been built piece by piece by the merchants, soldiers and elite of the Dutch Republic. Over the centuries, a large, continental colonial empire has been achieved. Although it suffered losses in the Great War, especially in the East Indian region with the local uprisings, the process of rebuilding and re-consolidating Dutch control has been relatively fast due to the uniquely Dutch way of colonial expansion and administration. Our pearl necklace will continue to shine."
PB_HOL_flanders_fields:0 "In Flanders Fields, The Poppies Blow"
PB_HOL_flanders_fields_desc:0 "The south of the country has remained ruined since the end of the Great War, with entire villages still left barren and old battlefields scarring the landscape. The psyche of Flanders too is scarred; with countless widows mourning both husband and son, while the younger generations retreat into crime and cheap pleasures to escape from the war’s lingering shadow."
PB_HOL_sapphire_revolution:0 "Echoes Of The Sapphire Revolution"
PB_HOL_sapphire_revolution_desc:0 "When the waves of reformation and revolution swept Europe in the last century we too were not left untouched. Following France’s adoption of liberalism the House of Orange found itself challenged by the radical Patriotten; with them demanding an end to the hereditary statholderate and the return to true republican values.\n\nThe so-called “§RPatriottentijd§!” continued until 1795 when a string of riots and subsequent crackdowns led to their violent seizure of Amsterdam. In a bid for peace the Kingdom of France intervened to save the republic from anarchy, hoping to prevent the ambitions of its own radicals by snuffing out the Dutch Jacobins and instituting the aristocratic “§CSapphire Revolution§!”. Although the statholderate was abolished among these reforms, the dreams of the Patriotten were crushed as the French reinforced the old oligarchy that was hoped to be overturned.\n\nNow over a hundred years later the same calls for change are being echoed by a new generation of radicals. Riots flood the streets as the people grow uncontrollably restless, having grown impatient by our government’s reluctance to democratise. We can only hope to weather the storm at this point."
PB_HOL_colosuss_of_sea:0 "Colossus Of The Sea"
PB_HOL_colosuss_of_sea_desc:0 "While the other nations of Europe dedicated themselves to the Green Sahara Project, we undertook our own. With the new technologies at our disposal Dogger Bank was raised to create the new islands of Nehalennia and Hesus. These islands would quickly develop into modern settlements on par with the British African Settlements, although much less populous."
