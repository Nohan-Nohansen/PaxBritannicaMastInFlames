  eldritch.1.t:0 "The Horror in Berkely Square"
  eldritch.1.d:0 "A curious phenomena has come to the attention of the authorities in London. 50 Berkely Square, an otherwise unassuming townhouse in Mayfair, has gained an odd reputation as of late for preternatural phenomena. The home had sat abandoned for the last twenty odd years after its' inhabitant Lanford Mayson was killed during deployment in the Great War. In that time, locals have regarded the estate with a general wariness. Children have reported on at least one occasion to see figures moving throughout the home during the day, vague shadows cast against the dusty curtains. Neighbors report the sounds of footsteps and wet sloshing at late hours of the night. In at least one instance, a teen entering the home on a dare fled screaming that there was \"a face on the stairs.\"\n\nWhile the London locals may be fully under the spell of Berkely Square's urban legend, Scotland Yard has dispatched a constable to the home to spend the night and determine if it may be housing vagrants or other criminal scum. Curiously, however, it has been nearly three days since the Constable entered the home and none in the police station have since heard from him. The locals are unwilling to investigate, and the other officers fear something may have happened to him."

  eldritch.2.t:0 "An Investigation in Berkely Square"
  eldritch.2.d:0 "A squad of Constables entered 50 Berkely Square this morning to find the entire home empty, save for the remains of the missing constable. He was found at the top of the stairwell, his head completely turned around like a twisted facsimile of an owl. The eyes, tongue and ears were also missing, though curiously they could not be found anywhere in the home.\n\nAn extensive investigation could find no clear cause of death, and the coroner reported that it seemed as though all the wounds were self-inflicted. The home itself was completely unremarkable, and seemingly untouched since it was last lived in. The constables left the home quickly, however, citing an incredibly uncomfortable feeling about the place. Whether this was caused by the dead body or something unrelated, they did not specify. Several of the constables did elaborate that they kept seeing \"dark shapes\" out of the corner of their eye, and on one occasion the sounds of footsteps in the attic.\n\nThe investigation ended rather quickly, however, as the home was taken over by a team of agents from the Imperial Intelligence Service's \"Special Care and Protocols\" department. Neighbors still report odd sounds and smells, but the IIS has strongly rebuffed these claims as simply a mold and rat infestation."

  eldritch.3.t:0 "Der König in Gelb"
  eldritch.3.d:0 "The German theatre scene has always been one of the most vibrant in Europe, and there is no lack of strange auteur productions since the birth of German surrealism. Curiously, there have been fliers appearing throughout Frankfurt advertising a new production called the \"King in Yellow\". The fliers contain no playbill or information about the production, only the venue it is being shown at and a single date, alongside an odd symbol resembling a spiral.\n\nThe odd advertising method has generated quite a bit of buzz and much of the city seems eager to see whatever this strange play may be."
  eldritch.3.a:0 "These Bohemian types get stranger every day"
  eldritch.3.b:0 "We should probably look into this."

  eldritch.4.t:0 "Der König in Gelb Premiers"
  eldritch.4.d:0 "Last night, the mysterious King in Yellow play premiered in a small venue in Frankfurt, yet despite attending the occasion none of those in attendance could recall anything about the play. Journalists have interviewed nearly every single person that could be located who claims to have seen it, yet when asked they either cannot recall the play or cannot recall having seen it in the first place.\n\nHaving sparked a fair amount of curiosity, police investigated the venue where the play premiered and found that it was visibly abandoned and boarded up. Records indicated that the theatre had gone out of business in 1924 and none of the people living in the area claimed to have seen anyone at the theatre last night. After breaking in, police found a single unidentified hung corpse on the main stage with the curtains open, with a large spiral symbol painted beneath it.\n\nNone of the fliers related to the play could be located, and aside from scant memories of it, it as as though the play never existed in the first place."
  eldritch.4.a:0 "How strange"

  eldritch.5.t:0 "Investigating Der König in Gelb"
  eldritch.5.d:0 "Spurred on by the strange play, journalists from the Frankfurt Globe newspaper decided to look into the bizarre fliers. A brief investigation found that no one could remember who had produced them or how they had found their way to various locations throughout the city. The material the fliers were made with was also curious, resembling an odd textured sort of paper that no one could quite describe the feeling of. One of the newspaper's writers claimed that she felt it \"breathe in her hand\" while looking it over late in the night.\n\nThe investigation ended abruptly when the lead writer of the Frankfurt Globe was found dead in his apartment from an apparent suicide. Police found the writer \"in too many pieces\", with incoherent rantings written in fresh blood across the walls of the apartment. Most prominently, the skin of his face was found nailed to the bathroom wall alongside the phrase \"Take Off Your Mask.\" What could not be explained was where the fresh blood came from, or how exactly the writer could have killed himself in such a bizarre manner. The Frankfurt Police refused to comment further on the matter, firmly stating that the writer had committed suicide and closing the case in less than a day.\n\nMore fliers appeared that afternoon, including one mailed to the Frankfurt globe, stating the play had to be \"relocated\". Nothing further has since come of the matter."

  eldritch.6.t:0 "INCIDENT REPORT UH6-DL1"
  eldritch.6.d:0 "Multiple complaints were intercepted by our office in the Basque Republic by Spanish peasantry in and around the former province of Asturias. Said province received extensive fighting during the Great War, and as a consequence was largely depopulated due to the introduction of Sulfur-Mustard into groundwater. Local complaints were deemed relevant to Imperial Intelligence due to frequent references to barbed wire, indicating potential uncontained livewire infestation, likely from wirebuds not disabled following the end of hostilities.\n\nAgents Maxwell and Darrow deployed to Asturias under cover of documentary telescreen filming. Due to the relative instability of the region, Spanish authorities did not question provided cover story. Agents arrived in unnamed Spanish village from which majority of complaints were intercepted at 0500 and reported that the area was completely abandoned, contrary to census records indicating a small remnant population of around 15 individuals. Area appeared to have been abandoned for some time prior to arrival, however multiple instances of recently extinguished candles were found. The reason for this is currently unknown.\n\nUpon investigation of the largest building, presumably some form of town hall, agents discovered the presence of a Class 4 uncontained wireform amalgamate in the basement. Instance was believed to be composed of the reconstituted remains of multiple townsfolk and a significant amount of uncontained livewire. Amalgamate did not instigate hostilities, however agents reported that at least one of the intact human bodies was capable of movement and \"smiled\" upon discovery.\n\nBuilding was burned along with amalgamate, uncontained wire deployment bud assumed lost. Upon return and review, Agent Darrow reported a previously undocumented skin infection on his lower back. Further investigation lead to the surgical removal of an immature 15 centimeter livewire instance attempting to perforate and attach itself to the spinal cord. Instance appeared to have gradually forced through subject's skin and muscle tissue at indeterminate point. Investigation into livewire tunneling and nesting behaviors is ongoing."
