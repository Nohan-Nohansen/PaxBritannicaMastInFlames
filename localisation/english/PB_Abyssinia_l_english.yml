  PB_ETH_Rising_Sun:0 "The Rising Sun of the Dark Continent"
  PB_ETH_Rising_Sun_desc:0 "Abyssinia's modern history was dramatically shaped by both their resistance to colonialism and the Great War. Abyssinia found a kindred spirit, strangely, in the pre-revolution Japanese Empire. The two nations found themselves in similar circumstances, with their neighbors being swallowed by hungry colonial powers and a desperate need to modernize. As the Scramble for Africa grew ever closer, Ras Tafari Makonnen, later Emperor Haile Selassie, pushed a series of dramatic political and military reforms as regent for Empress Zewditu. Following a brief power struggle and the death of the Empress, Makonnen succeeded her as Emperor of Abyssinia, giving him a far better position to push his modernization plan.\n\nThough Japan would ultimately fall to the perils of World War, Abyssinia continues to stand as a living monument for the battle against Imperialism in Africa. With yet another great catastophe on the horizon, Abyssinia must look to the future and truly decide which side she stands on."
  PB_ETH_Rastafarians:0 "The Rastafarian Movement"
  PB_ETH_Rastafarians_desc:0 "The Rastafarian Movement is an increasingly pervasive political force in Abyssinia. The movement in many ways has been heavily inspired by the various Black liberation movements in Western Europe and the Americas. What sets the Rastafari apart is their fanatical religious reverence for Emperor Selassie, to the point that many see the group as little more than a thinly veiled cult. In recent years, Abyssinia has become a lighting rod for the Rastafari, who have become increasingly militant and organized. Currently lead by Leonard Howell, they believe it is the god-ordained mission of the Emperor and Abyssinia to lead a crusade for the liberation of Africa. If such a radical movement were to take power, their rhetoric could easily get Abyssinia in hot water with the surrounding imperial nations."
  PB_ETH_Coup_Legacy:0 "Legacy of the Gugsa Wale Rebellion"
  PB_ETH_Coup_Legacy_desc:0 "Gugsa Wale was an army commander loyal to Empress Zewditu who in 1930 attempted a coup to remove Tafari Makonnen from power, thus making the Empress sole claimant to the succession. The rebellion was largely supported by reactionaries within the imperial elite, who felt that Makonnen's reforms threatened their power. Despite this support, Wale was decisively defeated at the Battle of Anchem and the rebellion eliminated. A critical problem arose, however, when Wale was able to narrowly escape into the nearby British client state of Egypt. Sheltered by the perfidious British, Wale has formed an insurgent band hellbent on revenge against Emperor Selassie. Should the current imperial government fail to keep his support under control, he may make a bid to seize control of Abyssina once again."
